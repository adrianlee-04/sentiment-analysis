The camera is okay and I love the edit features you can do to the pictures.  Amazon/Netflix/Huliu all run smoothly on this tablet. The internet runs a lot faster than our other tablet too.  While over all I am happy with this tablet it did come with a couple disappointments that I wanted to make sure other people are aware of.  I am an Amazon Prime member and I thought that with Amazon Prime you could read a lot of books for free with a kindle and was disappointed to see you can only borrow one kindle book a month for free. :(  Also one of the main reasons we purchased  a tablet was because my kids love the Plants vs Zombies games.  The kids were quite disappointed that Plants vs Zombies 2 is not available for the fire.  There are also other games/apps that we were looking forward to using that are not available on the Fire that were available for our previous cheaper Neutab tablet that we were looking forward to using on this tablet.  I recommend people ask about apps they are looking forward to using before buying.,31/08/2015,1

I was once given a ProntoTec 7&#34; tablet and it was so useless, I was put off on tablets altogether. But the Kindle Fire actually works, and works well. It's quick, responds accurately to my touch, and makes an excellent Kindle ebook reader. I've been reading like crazy since I got it. It also performs fine for simple things like checking email and getting notices from my gmail calendar. For other uses, like games, or anything that involves text input, I'd rather be at my desktop with a big screen and good keyboard. That's not a knock on the Fire, it's just my preference. The point is that I haven't been downloading apps and using them. Other than sitting in my easy chair and reading, I can't think of anything I'd rather do on a tablet than on a desktop PC.<br /><br />I once read that Amazon sells the Kindles at below cost in the hope the buyers will spend money on the books, movies, videos, subscription services, etc. I don't know if that is true, but really, a tablet isn't of any value without the content, so any review of the Kindle Fire must address that. I have enjoyed my free trials of both Amazon Prime and Kindle Unlimited (KU). Both are paid services that give you privileges and &#34;free&#34; stuff (that you are paying for with your subscription). I have decided to cancel both at the end of the free trial period next week. I'm not saying they aren't worth it. I've found a couple of good TV series on Amazon Prime (Bosch, Sneaky Pete) and read some good books from KU. But after checking my reading wish list against the KU offerings, I find that most of them are available on Kindle for money, but are not in the KU or Prime catalog. So I would still have to pay for them. Similarly, the best movies on Amazon video are not included in Prime. So despite paying for these free downloads and streams through the subscription, I'd still pay full retail on top of that. I don't see the point of the subscriptionif that holds true. I've downloaded the Overdrive app so I can get some of these ebooks from my local library. I'll try that for awhile. I'll also check out the free books that are always being offered on Amazon and see how good or bad they are. I may go back to KU after I've compared that experience. And I may just start buying Kindle books without the subscriptions services. I really like the Kindle for book reading.<br /><br />Your needs and tastes may vary. I just urge you to consider how you're going to use the Kindle. The Fire does not allow access to the Google app store downloads. You have to get your apps from Amazon's store. Many are free, but you can't necessarily get the ones you would like that are available for Android phones and tablets. Also, this model is wi-fi only, so it's not connected using the cell service data plans. That works for me because I don't take it out of the house, but you may want to spring for something more expensive if you need to be always connected.",30/08/2015,1

Before the update it would automatically load whichever profile was loaded when it shut down.  This change is causing a good deal of frustration with the toddler who used to be able to power it on and get into his profile with very little assistance.<br />Also, I purchased the full version of some preschool apps, but they cannot be used in the child's profile because it does not allow for in-app purchases.  While Amazon was willing to refund my money for the apps, their first response was to allow the child to use the apps in the parent's profile.  I felt that defeated the purpose of parental controls.  My husband and I use a Samsung tablet.  When we upgrade our tablet we're going to give our old one to the kids because the Samsung Kid's Mode app is more user-friendly--it allows in-app purchases to be used in Kid's mode and if the tablet shuts down in kid's mode, it reboots in kid's mode.",25/08/2015,0

I also have Webroot software to provide security for my laptop, desktop and phone, and I cannot get it to recognize the Fire tablet.  Apparently, Amazon has gone to such extremes to be proprietary, that it does not work with any other system or device.  I am very seriously considering sending it back.

I bought it to replace a Nexus 7 (original gen) that was getting on in years.  That was a mistake.  The Fire HD 7, while providing a nice screen, is very frustrating to deal with when you're coming from a more versatile system.  To be clear, the only things I really do on these devices is: 1) read books; 2) watch movies/shows on channel specific or general apps like Hulu, Netflix, Showtime, etc.; 3) occasionally browse the web; and 4) occasionally play games.  For these simple purposes, the Fire is okay, but barely.  Because it's a closed system, you can only download apps from Amazon, who doesn't have the full complement of apps available on Google Play.  You can root the Fire, but that's way more work than should be necessary for something like this.<br /><br />Then there's the battery life, which is horrible.  I now rarely use the Fire because it always needs to be charged.  I can have it fully charged, read something on it for 30 minutes, put it down for a day, and come back to find it's out of juice.  My old Nexus 7 doesn't even eat battery like that!  That makes this thing an occasional device to use after my Nexus runs down.  Added to that, despite its use of the universal Micro USB, it only seems to charge on its own cord, which makes meet think it's poorly constructed to boot.<br /><br />Bottom line: I regret wasting my money on this and will not be buying again, or recommending to anyone else to purchase unless it's super cheap.",20/08/2015,0

I have used and am very comfortable with both iOS (apple) and Android. the main idea with those is to have a few apps on the bottom with a library in the middle. the kindle makes it different where there are large &#34;recent history&#34; apps which side scroll in the middle. then on the bottom there is another row of &#34;favorites&#34; on the bottom. with a swipe up from the bottom tray you can access all of the apps you choose to have there, (like a hidden home screen). The search function is also mainly geared towards finding things on amazon and makes anything that is on the store come up first.<br /><br />--Part 2 [Free time]: (Excellent) this is the main reason i purchased the kindle, this way i could give it to my daughter and not have to worry about her getting into system files or getting into anything that sheshouldn't be seeing as well as making it easy for her to grow with the best parental controls offered without competition. This combined with an easily buyable foam case makes this by far the most toddler/child/kid friendly.<br />****one downside of free time that i have found; is that you cannot give the &#34;free time&#34; app access to your uploaded videos; i wanted to give my daughter access to some movies that i had on my computer, i uploaded them to the device but you can not give the freetime app access to those videos. i suppose it has to do with the fact that videos cannot be categorized so they don't give it access or if it is just overlooked because many people don't know how to directly upload videos to the devices.<br /><br />App store: (Fair): This is another possible weakness of the kindle; the reason being is that there are not as many apps available for the kindles as as the google play store or the apple app stores. One thing to note is that the kindle operating system is much newer than android and apple so this is normal. just like not that long ago there were more apps for apple than android, however today that is reversed. Currently there are not as many apps that i want to put for my daughter (kindle only has endless alphabet, where android and apple have all 3 endless alphabet, words, numbers)<br /><br />overview: I really like the kindle fire that I purchased, it is a great tablet that my daughter can grow into and use for years to come without me constantly looking over her shoulder or locking her in and out of specific apps (iOS guided access). There are many things that amazon can improve, however it is a great system for kids and for reading.<br /><br />*Caution; if you are looking for a tablet to organize your life with productivity/organization apps, i highly recommend you look some place else. the kindle is EXCELLENT for kids, and parental controls.",18/08/2015,1

Being a Prime Member and having to wait that long is disappointing because the member ship fee isn't exactly cheap. The thing that makes me wonder is why did Amazon have a claim queue for the Fire HD 7 during prime day, making you think they had enough stock of this tablet at the discounted price just to tell me the next day after I ordered it that it wasn't in stock. So they oversold items that they didn't have in stock. I wanted this to arrive in time so that my girlfriend could use it for her trip to Europe but I wasn't able give it to her in time.

Nothing is where you expect it to be. Nothing works like you expect it to. The UI feels like a too-tight sweater. Performance was awful. I was beginning to wonder if I had wasted my money.<br /><br />Then, my wife reminded me why I bought it: I wanted a bigger screen to read books and newspapers on. So I forced myself to use it for just that purpose.<br /><br />Got to say that when viewed from this perspective, it's a decent gadget. The UI makes sense (sort of) if all you're doing is reading a from a few sources all the time. I can see where Aunt Grace from Peoria would get the hang of it pretty quickly- and that's Amazon's true audience with this product.<br /><br />After seeing what it can't do, I'm wondering is one of the PaperWhite devices might have been a better deal as a pure reader- better display, better battery. Something I'd consider if I was buying again.<br /><br />Since I guess I'm stuck with my choice now, the big things I'd complain about are the glossy screen in bright light (hoping I can find a matte screen protector to remedy this), battery life (about a half-day of solid reading), and overall performance (forget about listening to Amazon music while reading).<br /><br />Summary: As long as you keep telling yourself it's a reader and not a full-up tablet, you'll be OK. If you're looking for a reader for Mom, Grandma, or Aunt Gracie, this might work. If you're looking for a full-up tablet, look elsewhere.

I'm mostly a reader, with a few games and some Internet surfing, maybe a few old TV shows; I used it a lot and bought a LOT of book content because it was much easier to read on the Kindle than the Touch or my iPhone. Until 2.25 years in, this past spring, when the screen started flickering and then breaking up totally. I could not find a solution online and decided to buy a new Fire when it was on sale around Mother's Day. First problem: my books were not all showing in the Cloud. That was lengthy call #1 and included the CS rep saying that I would have to upload each book individually because some had updates (!). Today was lengthy call #2 because the Home icon opened to what looked like the App tab (but wasn't, because it included some books that hadn't been opened in months). That required a factory reset and again, hey, not all of my book content was showing in the Cloud! The CS pushed them out remotely. Not what's supposed to happen!

It's an extraordinarily fast device for the price with a brilliant screen. I understood the limitations with the Amazon Marketplace and bought it anyway. However, Fire OS leaves a lot to be desired. This device will not screen cast to my Fire TV. I see no reason for this limitation. In fact, it will not allow Chromecast at all.So, I was going to give this a 3 star review.

I can even install side load play store apps.<br /><br />There is only one con and that is the keyboard. It is very slow to respond. Takes a few seconds to load. Then even when it is displayed, it is isn't done loading so I often type 3 letters that never show up. I finish typing and wait a few more seconds for the letters to catch up to my typing. But since I am missing the first 3, I have to start over again. If you use this as media device, this is not an issue. But if you do light forum discussions as I do, then it is too distracting for my tablet browsing experience.

It was the only thing I wanted on prime day. It is still all the limitations of an amazon tablet vs a regular tablet -- including the REALLY annoying aspect of going through the internet to use youtube when obviously an app would be a lot easier and less temper-tantrum-throwing on amazon's part. It also feels a bit cheap--plastic-y and a bit of bulk and girth for being so hollow seeming inside. It has some bugs--it tends to freeze up quickly, and it tends to get really confused during high-demand apps like netflix and I've had to power it down and restart it a couple times already because of this issue. I have to completely get out of the program before turning the screen off to fix this.<br /><br />But for $100, it has a lot of memory and space, it saved the day when I needed something else with internet access when the wireless card on my laptop went out, and I use amazon frequently since I have prime so I have access to the shows, and the music, and all of that jazz. I also like having it small enough to shove in my purse or bag to take with me. I do want a bigger tablet eventually, but this is perfect for pulling up a recipe I need to cook with from online, or plugging into the stereo to play music while I do things around the house. It's a great little tablet, if you can get over the amazon-only limitations. A lot of people can't, which is understandable.... but hey, I have a smart phone, and a laptop, and between those two things I can deal with it. Also it DOES support netflix, which is the other really big thing I use it for.<br /><br />Having prime? I think for $100 this tablet is worth it. I would NOT have paid $159 for this tablet, but I thought the $100 price tag was fair.",16/08/2015,1

I thought Amazon was ''the one''. I  decided to commit and became a prime member. Me and Amazon together forever.  So when Amazon decided to have a day dedicated to me- its prime member-I felt obliged to reciprocate by purchasing a Fire HD. My IPad Mini had recently left me a widow, so the timing was perfect. It was meant to be.  Finally, my new late night reading companion arrived.  Well, you can imagine my horror when I charged it up, turned it on, and some buxom babe advertising a game app popped up on my screen.  Amazon knew I would not want this constant reminder of my beloved's two-timing ways, and offered to discontinue this advertising affair for an extortion fee of $15. I felt so used. But what's a girl to do? Obviously, I was never special. No doubt there were signs (and small print) that I missed. But love can be blind. Yes, our relationship has continued.

Come August 1st, they still hadn't shipped it yet so I waited a few days before notifying Amazon. When I fianlly did, they notified me they were out of stock until the 10th of August. I was very excited to get my kindle, but I understood that they had a high demand for it. I love Amazon and the Amazon experience, so I wanted a Kindle Fire since I already had a Kindle Paperwhite. I wanted a tablet that was fully compatible with Amazon (such as Amazon instant video, audio books, etc.,) and also a tablet in which I can do the same things that I do on my android phone. Unfortunately, I was disappointed to find out that Amazon is very limited in the apps available for download. There is also not much customization available. These two things were a big downfall for me to be honest. The camera also isn't that good, which I already knew prior to buying it but I didn't mind.  The special offers on the lock screen bother me and I have tried to remove them, but there is no option to. Another small issue is typing; it is very with the cursor when I need to retype something. Ultimately, the kindle Fire HD 7 runs pretty smooth, has a nice screen resolution, and the volume is surprisingly loud. It is a good price for a tablet, but if I would have known the apps and customization are limited, I would have preferred a Galaxy.

But there are also tons of cons for it which is making me anticipate another tablet for actual internet usage and save this strictly for eReading. Biggest disappointment is the fact that it doesn't connect to the Google Play store and seriously hinders which apps I can add. Seems most of the apps I want/like are not available from the Amazon store which renders most of my non-reading usage useless. Second biggest disappointment is how poorly this connects to wi-fi. It takes forever sometimes to connect to my home wi-fi and it drops way too easily. Say I'm connected but I step away from it for an hour, when I come back to it, I'll have to spend another 5-10 minutes trying to get it to reconnect again which is seriously annoying.<br /><br />However, as an eReader, I enjoy the different backgrounds and fonts that suit my likes, as well as the number of books I can load to it.<br /><br />If you're looking for a colored eReader, this gets a plus but for anyone who wants to use this as a respectable tablet too, I'd get something else for apps.",12/08/2015,0

The first few days it worked alright, it was a little slow when I did anything besides reading books, even checking my email.  I knew I would only be able to download apps from the Amazon store but as I had never used it before I was unaware how limited it was.  After 5 days (Yes, 5!!!) the screen became stuck on landscape mode.  I tried everything I could think of to fix it but nothing helped so I finally contacted customer service.  After repeating everything I'd already done (turning screen rotation on & off and turning the device on and off) they told me we would have to do a factory reset.  I attempted to do the factory reset while still on the phone with customer service and the screen just froze on the loading screen.  After waiting several minutes the customer service rep said he had done everything he could and they would send me a replacement.  I received the replacement quickly but this one only worked for one day before messing up in a completely different way.  The screen partially froze, I could click on some things but pretty much nothing reacted .  I couldn't open or close anything at all.  I couldn't even get the device to shut off!  After setting the device down and leaving it for about 20 minutes to talk to someone from customer service again I came back to find the bottom half of the screen completely black.  You could still see the image on the top half of the device but the bottom half was all black.  At that point I decided to return the device and not try a 3rd time.<br /><br />I am aware that these things happen sometimes with devices (odd that it happened to 2 of mine) so I am not giving it a 1 star.

I guess my chief complaint is the lock screen, I don't want to see your dumb ads for apps and products I don't want Amazon, I already purchased your tablet leave me alone. Another big problem I have is the amazon app store itself. Maybe having an android for years spoiled me because the google play store is by far superior, if you use play store or Apple app store then switching to amazon app store will drive you insane. Not only do they not have the games and apps I love and use, they bombard you with sub quality apps and games and  they all heavily utilize in game purchasing (maybe just the ones I checked out and possibly a problem with the phone game and app business in general but still upset me). The last big point I have to make is the lack of customization allowed. You basically can't customize anything, as I mentioned before the lock screen is always some ad amazon is throwing in your face, but the home screen also cannot be changed, just a black screen with your app icons there. I really wish, like my phone and my brothers tablet, you could add your own pictures or even change the app icons themselves, but alas I'm stuck with this sub par tablet.

PRO - Amazon Prime and this thing are a GREAT combo. I have downloaded movies and TV shows for the plane, it is a good size to use on the plane or in an airport. Not bulky like a laptop, a little smaller than an iPad. great for the tray on the plane with enough room for your drink and peanuts(!). The fact that I get to download Prime Videos as part of my Prime membership is a huge plus. 2. PRO - Sound is good, I used them with a cheap set of earbuds, an average set of noise cancelling headphones and a great set of earbuds. Sound was good on all. 3. PRO - Picture/screen is better than I thought it would be. Video is crisp, no chop or stutter on playing video. 4. PRO - I bought the Amazon case with the fold back stand. Works very well, keeps the unit at a good viewing angle. Buttons and earphone jack are easily accessible. 5. PRO - Battery seems to be better than originally thought. Fully charged I can easily watch two movies on a plane trip if needed. Does nto lose its charge overnight all the time. 6. CON - It still seems to be a little flaky. I watched 2 episodes of Bosch (watch this Amazon Prime series!) on a flight, then changed planes. I closed the cover to sleep it and when I got on the next plane I had to hold the power button for about 30 seconds then power it back on. Will be calling Amazon about this when I get a chance. 7. CON - Just a little thing but sometimes the ads get in the way of the game play.  Overall I can give it a solid 3. If I get the flakiness worked out with the locking up (only thing I can call it), I would change it to 3 1/2. Worth the $99 I paid for it, not sure if I would pay $159 for it.  Well I finally grabbed a Kindle FireHD on Prime Day. I have 4 iPads, 2 Android tablets, and 1 Asus Win8 tablet, and a Surfacec Pro 3 tablet. I got the Fire for Plex and Amazon Prime. Received my Fire on Aug 4, could not use it until Aug 7.  My early thoughts are  - Meh. Not any kind of special tablet. I will list my pros and cons:  Pros Size is about right for a really portable tablet (not thickness, but width and height) Amazon prime gets to download movies/TV shows for offline viewing All (most) of my FireTV apps can be used, don't have to repay Sound is pretty good, slightly better than the iPad speaker. Have not tried with earphones yet, like I will be using on a plane Can read my Kindle books on it (Thats about it for pros, will update if I think of more)  Cons Weight - with the Amazon case it weighs just 4.3oz less than my full size iPad Air 2 with the Apple case, without case it is 5.2 oz less. Also uncomfortable holding in one hand to read Size - this thing is pretty thick. Hey Amazon, thin is in. Thickest tablet I own Battery life - not very good at all. Have had to recharge it every morning since I received it, it runs completely down overnight, despite having about 35% battery when I go to bed. If it continues I will contact Amazon support, as battery life is nothing like what is advertised. Slow - a very sluggish device. Not as bad as my other Android tablet but nowhere near what my iPad air is. Angry Birds took a full 55 seconds to load after a complete reboot. Not good. I am going on a couple of trips over the next few weeks and will be updating after I get back. Overall it is really a 2 1/2 star device but Amazon only allows whole stars. I spent 99 bucks on it so not really a huge deal, but for someone spending $159 for it (and STILL have to put up with the ads at that price) it will be a 1 star, in my opinion.",11/08/2015,0

The device was fully charged and when I used it a second time and after less than three hours usage I logged onto the internet and the device froze up and stayed that way for at least 12 hours.

I thought that since this was an Android device, I would be able to access FlashPlayer and be able to stream some online things that I like, as well as view an electronic magazine that I had subscribed to specifically because I got this device.  No Flash, so why did I waste $20 on the magazine subscription?  I'm trying to log in through my service, and it won't verify my e-mail/password combo, although I can access the magazine through my MacBook.  WTF.  Not really happy with the slowness of the operating system when it comes to apps.  Also don't like that I can't download Instagram.  The quality of video is not great on the screen either.  Really HATED the special offers, which was forcing me to watch commercials every time I unlocked the bloody screen.  Paid $15 more to get rid of that.  Just be honest, Amazon, and don't bother with the fricken' &#34;special offer&#34; price.  I also don't like that I can't seem to download a regular Google e-mail for my work e-mail, and so I'm forced to see ads while I'm trying to stay in touch with the office in my off hours.  Having said that, the Kindle function itself is fine most of the time.  Not sure if it's the device or Overdrive through my local library, but once I get halfway through a loaned eBook, I start having problems with missing the first page of a chapter.  What's up with that?  So now - all things considered.  If this thing takes a dive, I will simply save my money longer and buy an iPad, because this operating system is for the birds.  We've got two Mac desktop computers and two Mac laptops, as well as iPhones.  Believing that Flash would be included on this Android device was the only real selling point for me.  Because it's a good reader, it's not a total loss, so to sum up - meh.  And this was after reading and rereading reviews, and considering the purchase for months.",9/08/2015,0

The power cord has already quit working, I have only had this two weeks. There is nothing on the outside of the cord to indicate that it was damaged at home in any way.

It does not pick up my wifi on my deck, where every other android device we own has a strong signal, so that's definitely the Fire.<br />To put this in perspective, I bought this at half price for ~$80.

A lot of wasted space around the sides of the screen.<br /><br />Battery life is HORRIBLE. I've mostly read on it and the battery drains way too fast.

Special offers are ads on your fire hd, which I did not know about until the day I received it. I did not like how the interface looked, with the rather large Most Recent icons up top and the same icons at the bottom but in smaller size. I found it useless, cluttered, and a waste of space. I had no use for many of the pre-installed apps and features on the Fire HD 7, such as firefly, free time (meant as parental controls for children's use), the Help app, and contacts. Many apps from the app store are not able to be downloaded on the Fire HD, and a lot of the apps I have on my iPhone such as youtube and instagram don't exist for the Fire HD either. The camera isn't that great, in my opinion. It's not HD either. The iPhone and iPad cameras are top notch compared to Fire HD 7. The home screen and lock screen cannot be customized at all, in any shape or form. There is no option for wallpapers or to change the way it looks. The preset wallpaper slideshow on my lock screen freaked me out and gave me the heebie jeebies because they're macro photos (close to it) and photos of plants and nature, which I do not like. I rather have a picture of a cute dog from my camera roll as my wallpaper. (Cant do much with your photos but to upload them onto social networks and edit and print)<br />One thing I do like, is the emoticons in your keyboard. They're different than the emojis on an iPhone keyboard and are actually cute!<br />Overall, I didn't really like the Fire HD 7 as much as I thought I would. The device does not allow any customization whatsoever and includes lots of features (the ones that aren't listed on the description) and apps that I have no use for. The camera isn't HD as it says it is, it's not even close to hd. Nothing to be excited about honestly. I like my technology to be savvy, customizable, and minimal.

I also know that any future purchases will be manually included into a collection as they are purchased.

Worse is the fact any content you own through Google Play Store is cannot be used on the Kindle Fire. Having been an Android phone user for years, I own a lot of content I can install and run on all of my Android devices except this one. It's a pretty cynical marketing ploy which makes the device feel less-than-premium.

It was never mishandled or dropped. It simply stopped working. These things are too inexpensive to warrant repair so that was the end of that. I told myself at the time I would not buy another, but my one year old iPad just malfunctioned! That's right. After a year, the headset receptacle failed, and it is more expensive to repair than it is to buy a Kindle Fire, so here I am again with a new one. For the money, it is fair to say the Kindle Fire is a reasonable purchase. I won't go into packaging and other factors that are irrelevant to watching media. Let me start by saying the icons and other information on the screen is way too small for me to read without a magnifying glass. Admittedly, my old eyes are not what they were, but really, this is an avoidable problem Amazon. The data on the screen should be easily readable even by me, by going to &#34;Settings.&#34; Except there is no &#34;Settings.&#34; Secondly, when you power on the device, a pop-up add appears. I didn't buy a Kindle Fire so I would be forced to look at adds for diapers and women's vaginal cream. I want to see a nice clean screen. The Amazon logo would be okay, or a view of mountain peaks perhaps... Thirdly, a list of  options is stretched across the top of the home screen in small print and below that, are a series of icons. This is not intuitive arrangement and does not flow cognitively. Come on Amazon, find a better means of presentation. I looked at the apps on the Kindle Fire, and it's apparent I'm not through with the iPad. Many of the apps on iPad are not available on the Kindle Fire even though they are free. All this being said, picture quality is very good, and so is sound quality, the two main factors is judging the value of device. I have Amazon Prime, a wonderful service offering countless free movies and TV shows, including Amazon exclusives like House of Cards, and I can find old black and white movies on Amazon too, not available on Netflix for instance, like In Harm's Way, with John Wayne.

You can check my other reviews and note that I rate fairly and honestly and that I have been a faithful Amazon customer for many years.<br />I had purchased a Kindle several years back when they were new and eBooks were just coming into vogue. I liked the device (though at the time I was disappointed that Kindle books were often more expensive than paperback versions) and quickly adapted to using it. Unfortunately the screen went berserk and that was the end of that. I continued to purchase Kindle books using my computer to read them because I had been converted to eBooks; however, that does not mean that I had been converted to Kindle devices. That experience with the Kindle device had soured me on Amazon's reader. I like dependable tools and that Kindle failed in that respect.<br />Fast forward to last October and my mother-in-law's diagnosis with terminal brain cancer (she was soon restricted to hospital and nursing home care). To keep her involved in photos and videos of daily family life we purchased a Kindle Fire for her. It was a great way to share photos, books, etc. with her and the Fire performed well for her until she passed on three months later. My wife has used that Fire since then.<br />Fast forward four months later to when my wife purchased a Fire for me even though I had declined purchasing one several times previously  when they came on sale at Amazon. I had failed to tell her that I did not trust Amazon's electronic devices [sorry Amazon, great retailer as you are, I do not trust your Kindle devices). I have used it sparingly, mainly because I had become accustomed to using my PC to read Kindle books. The novelty of the reader was diminished because of my first experience with a Kindle reader.<br />Fast forward two months to now: my Kindle Fire HD 7 will not turn on and will not charge. Yes, yes, I have tried every online Google-search remedy (and the charger workson the other Fire). NOTHING works. The magical 20 seconds, 30 seconds, press the On button after, before, and during charging. Wiggle the charging plug gently. Nada, zilch, zero, NOTHING. I even turned around three times with my eyes shut and spit three times. Anybody want an expensive flat paperweight?<br />Anyhow, I have read the many complaints posted here about this device. I have also read the many complaints about Amazon's poor response and support for those many customers who have been maligned by Amazon via this device. I am going to contact Amazon about this. I will post the results. Meanwhile, I do not recommend that you purchase ANY Kindle device. This is not only because of my experience with this device, but because, like other products that I have purchased that are made in China, it is a roll of the dice to learn whether the item received is the result of good quality control or of poor quality control. I avoid Chinese products because I have found them to be unreliable (in one case, the item never arrived and neither did the replacement for it).",28/07/2015,0

There are a few design flaws I will get into. The first come with the placement of the microphone in regards to the speakers. When using Skype or any app requiring speakers and the microphone to function simultaneously, the microphone will pic up on the sound from the speakers causing terrible distortion, rendering some calls almost impossible. Another design flaw comes with the power button. It is almost right on the charger, and is easy to hit when plugging in/unplugging the tablet. It's a minor annoyance, but I really feel Amazon could have done better. The back of the tablet is slick, but that is easily remedied with a case.<br /><br />Prime video, Netflix, games, and other apps look amazing, The sound is surprisingly crisp.

I currently use a Nexus 7, and I'm going to continue using it. The Fire HD is cheap, flimsy and continuously locks up, but that's not the worst thing about it. Amazon has gone to great lengths with the Fire to keep you constrained within the Amazon family of apps. I use the Chrome browser across all my devices. To use Chrome on my Fire I had to go online to find out how. Then I had to install 3rd party software on the  Fire, and install Chrome using that software. I acquire most of my apps from the Play store, and while there is probably some way to install the Play store app on the Fire, I didn't bother to discover it because I've given up on the Fire HD.<br /><br />I bought Amazon's product, and they expressed their gratitude by trying to put me in a virtual prison cell. They've created a product that attempts to restrict you to &#34;Amazon approved&#34; products. I'm sorry, but I wanted a tablet not a parent. When I bought my Nexus two years ago it came with the Google apps preinstalled. No attempt was made to restrict me to Google apps. I'm free to install any Android OS app from any source. I'm so irritated by my experience with the Fire HD that it's actually tarnished my opinion of Google, since the Fire OS is a proprietary version of the Android OS.<br /><br />If you are considering purchasing a Fire HD, or any Fire product, don't do it. Spend a pittance more and get the Nexus 7. Mine is about two years old and still serving me well. I use it everyday, including for reading books I buy through the Kindle app. See what I mean? My Nexus hasn't tried to restrict me to the Play Books app.<br /><br />SHAME ON AMAZON! SHAME, SHAME, SHAME!",25/07/2015,0

Forget It","Let me first say that I am generally very happy with Amazon, and I have had Kindles since 2010. The problem is that if you avail yourself of the free Kindle book promotions that are constantly happening in addition to your occasional regular ebook purchases, you will amass several thousand in your account. And before long, you could easily have more than 10,000, 20,000, or 30,000 or more. Now I'm NOT talking about trying to put all of these books onto the Kindle--it simply won't be able to, nor would I want to. I'm simply talking about having these &#34;purchased&#34; Kindle books in your account, ready to download at your whim. When I got my HD7 16GB last week, I followed all the instructions. So far so good. Until I simply clicked on &#34;Books.&#34; Mistake. It went to the Books--Cloud section and began trying to list all 17,000 or so books in my account. I let this run for several hours. I found that If I clicked on Home while this was running, then it took about 5 minutes (yes, minutes!) for it to change to my Home screen. And this is BEFORE I had downloaded a single book to the unit!<br /><br />So I left it plugged in to the charger overnight and hoped for the best the next day. But there was no improvement after an entire day had passed. Basically, because I have a lot of &#34;purchased&#34; Kindle books in my Amazon account, this Kindle is useless. I have a first original Kindle Fire that I was hoping to upgrade for this one, but sadly, the original Fire outperforms this HD7.<br /><br />I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it will probably work just fine for you if you curb your appetite for free Kindle books and keep your total significantly below the 10,000 count. (I don't really know what the count needs to be under for the Kindle to not bog down, so it could even be maybe 5,000?) Again, I really wanted this HD7 to work, but it is apparent that the designers at Amazon are ignoring those of us who have many many purchased Kindle books in our accounts. Not very forward-looking in my opinion, since eventually there will be more and more Kindle customers who will collect very high numbers of Kindle books in their accounts. AGAIN: I'm not talking about downloading these books on the Kindle! I'm simply saying that the Kindle bogs waaaaaaaay down because of the high number of Kindle books that are available in my Amazon account. Kindles need to be designed to accommodate ALL of the customers' accounts, not just those who don't buy very many ebooks.",23/07/2015,0

My eight year old son purchased the Kindle fire with his own ??ard=earned??money we chipped in for the extended warranty and the case knowing that there could be issues with and Eight year old and a tablet. We were sold due to the sophistication of the parental controls and how we thought they will encourage his reading. Within a month the product froze up, under warranty we got an easy exchange, after that switch the tablet lasted a year when the screen shut down. As the tech support identified the screen as ??ead?? and as we are two month past the warranty there is nothing they can do about it, no fix, no exchange, but a ??iscounted??price which is higher than currently sold outright on a retailer or in the Amazon market place. So my son has a $200 paperweight and Amazon expect me to purchase another one. (By the way he took great care of it, no dings, nicks or even scratches) I understand about planned obsolescence but two tablets within a year seem extreme, and makes this more of a disposable product than I could recommend. My wife has an iPad, and I have a nexus, both products are excellent and worth the cost. If Amazon?? expectations is that we will purchase a new one every year,  in three years you have already paid for the iPad which has more apps, more programs and more capacity, even less to  pay for the nexus, mine even got wet and still works. If you??e looking for a disposable tablet that lasts a year, go ahead and get as you will save some money but if you expect the product to last longer than that, get something else as not only it will cost the same but you have to add the hassle of having to deal with customer service every time it goes down.

I spoke with Stepahie who also tried to troubleshoot it. No luck so she said she'd mail me a new one. I explained paid for a screen cover and didn't expect to have to purchase another one a couple months later, so she said there would be one in my shipment.  I thought great and wonderful customer service. When I got my package my screen cover wasn't there. I called explaining my situation and was told they do not give the covers out for free. Eventually, after two hours three calls, one hang up on me and a supervisor later I got my screen cover. Of course, it doesn't fit my Fire. Horrible product and experience.

Returned it Th/Aug20th, and today THIS one arrived. We'll give it time, see how it goes.   Every kindle I've EVER purchased has come with a charger. Including the 2 defective ones. THIS particular kindle came ONLY with the USB port. When I called customer service, I was informed they've NEVER come with a charger!! BULLPUKKEY!! I was definitely NOT happy being told this, and I asked for, and got, a higher up to aid me. The little box that plugs INTO the wall AND kindle so it can be fed, is the RIDICULOUS PRICE of $19.99, plus tax,s&h!! He took off the $19.99 charge, but the shipping was just under $14.00!! I pitched a MAJOR fit, as BOTH kindles I'd just returned came WITH the ENTIRE chargers!! I SHOULD be receiving the new charger(aka:ADAPTER)within a week, and with NO charges for it. WHERE was PAUL when I needed-and ASKED for him- as I'd been instructed??   If THIS 3dkindle has ANY technical difficulties due to being DEFECTIVE, I'm DEFINITELY returning it and getting a refund, which I will then use to purchase a BETTER product locally, such as a SAMSUNG GALAXY!!!

No a DUD. The screen is not sensitive. Often I'll touch a book three or four times before it opens.  And 8GB is not enough. I have ONE Game my Kindle, Minecraft for my son. Still I have to archive my books and all but ONE audiobook at a time or the wireless shuts down because my storage is full. It's almost not worth it to have audiobooks with this Kindle.  I can't download if I don't have WIFI and then it takes fifteen minutes to download an audiobook. I haven't bought one since I've owned this Kindle. I mean Seriously?! This is 2015. I shouldn't have to wait 15 minutes for anything digital. My old Kindle would allow me to search the internet at will.  This one is so unresponsive that I just put it aside and reach for my laptop.

I would never have bought this for myself. I have heard nothing but good things about it like great lightening and high definition, easy access to all social media, and portable with lasting life battery. I had high expectations for my Kindle. As an avid reader I was so excited to have a portable device for my reading habits. When I received my kindle and began messing around with it, I have been somewhat disappointed in the all-around product.<br /> The product is very portable and has great lighting and definition. With it being portable I can take it anywhere in my purse. It?? about the size of my hand spread out and only weighs about a pound an half with a case on. The brightness of screen is adjustable and really helpful when in various lighting. Whether it be outside or indoors I can still see the screen.<br /> The main thing that disappoints me about this product, is the inability to change the lock and home screen. I might not have such a problem with the screen if there was a default picture but there is not, it is a different advertisement each time I go to slide open the screen. I find it annoying when there is a different screen each time I want to open my kindle up. ??ou can't even choose your own wallpaper or lock wallpaper. You have to pay to get rid of the ads you see every time you turn it on.?? I have searched the internet and it seems that there is no way to change it.<br /> Another bad thing that I don?? like is the battery life. The hold for the battery life is not that great. I take it off the charger and it immediately begins to lose the battery hold. For a portable reading device I would have liked something that would be able to hold a full day?? charge, if I don?? turn it off after every use I can only get maybe 6 hours out of it.<br /> I would defiantly think twice before purchasing this product, if you want something portable and just for fun oruse to shop online this could be your electronic device. If you want something you could use all day for multiple things I would maybe look at another product. This one is probably not the best product and I would give it like 2 out of 5 stars",30/06/2015,0

After doing extensive research, I read in several online articles that this Fire tablet would be able to mirror to my TV through the Fire TV. However, that ended up being not true. It wasn't true even a little bit. I tried to run the mirror functionality through YouTube and multiple other apps. However, after a call to Amazon support, the customer service rep and I discovered that the only thing that you can mirror is the Amazon Prime video app. To be blunt, that is silly. The Amazon Fire TV already does that so why would mirroring for this app even be necessary most of the time?<br /><br />Luckily, Amazon support handled the matter swiftly and my refund was taken care of completely within a few days.

I had two of 3 older ones that my family loved but I have 5 kids so three wasn't enough.  The way the older Kindle's worked with Freetime we loved it.  I hate these things!  I mean HATE these two new ones!  First off when it says 8GBs it really means about 3 GB for you to actually do anything with.  Second the way Freetime now works you are required to have an internet connection in order to open the program.  If you don't have internet, you are not allowed in to Freetime.  Those fun apps your kids downloaded to the system through Freetime are now stuck within Freetime and you cannot access them to play or delete until you go back into Freetime.  AGAIN, You cannot enter Freetime unless you have an internet connection.  If you are on the road and something happens where the kid gets them self out of Freetime too bad, you can't get back until you find internet.  This happened REPEATEDLY on our road trip.  Daughter was playing a game in Freetime and decided she wanted to do something else.  Pushed the home button which is supposed to take her to Freetime home but instead kicked her out of Freetime and sent her to the regular home page.  Now she can't get back into Freetime to play her games because she has no internet.  The other problem is the lack of space.  If your child downloads too many apps in freetime it will complain there isn't enough space, then turns off the wifi and won't allow you back into freetime because there is no internet. Now you can't delete the apps because they are locked away in freetime, you can't get into freetime because there is no wifi connection, you can't get a wifi connection because there isn't enough space, and you can't free up space because the apps taking up the space are stuck in freetime.  See the problem.  Even though I have enough Kindles to go around for my kids, they still fight over the old ones because those are the only ones that work properly.

I purchased a new Kindle Fire in June of 2015.  I waited almost 4 years to upgrade, and was very excited to get a new model.  I mostly use the Kindle for reading and game playing, although I also read news sites such as CNN, USA Today and my local site KGW News.  I don't use it for music, or video.  I have to say that out of the 5 or 6 Kindles that I have purchased over the past 10 years, this is by far the most disappointing.  It is very buggy.  It freezes without reason, usually after going into sleep mode.  I will open a book to read and find that the Back and Home buttons don't work, and I cannot access the Settings ribbon.  Sometimes, the splash screen (with the ads) will either display an image that is pinched (very narrow) or stretched (very wide).  If I play a game like Cubis Creatures, and accidently let the Fire go into sleep mode, the game will not usually re-appear when I wake it again - although I can hear it playing in the background.  Sometimes when I open a book or access Settings, I have to wait for 20, 30, 40 seconds before the screen appears.  I have resorted to Force Stopping every app I use (other than the Reader), so that nothing runs in the background that might interfere with usage.  I read quite a lot and may have the Fire in use for 5 or 6 hours - the battery life is too short and I have resorted to keeping it plugged in while I read so that it will not shut down in the middle of an activity.  In order to address most of these issues, I restart this thing at least 3 times a day and am very, very frustrated that I wasted my money  on such a piece of junk.  I will most likely go back to using my 4-year old model, even though it occasionally freezes and has to be rebooted, it is no where near as frustrating and disappointing as the new model.",28/06/2015,0

I had an RCA 7&#34; tablet I purchased at Walmart's Black Friday sale last November. Unfortunately, I dropped it and ruined it, but I really wish it were still working. That $30 tablet was much more user friendly than this Fire is, and the graphics, while not as good, were good enough. This Kindle fire irritates me to no end Folks. For one thing, there's so much preinstalled on it when you turn it on that a good portion of your 8GB's of memory is unavailable. The memory you're left with will let you install a handful of games and one movie. If you want pics and tunes on your Fire I suppose you'd need to be connected to the Internet 100% of the time, which I am not, and I'm not paying AT&T another $100/mo so I have 24/7 access to content stored on the Cloud. You can't add memory to this device. You're stuck with the 8GB's, and it's insufficient. Let me add: I have two Kindles--a Keyboard and a Paperwhite, which work perfectly well, so I didn't purchase the Fire strictly as an eReader. However, I am an avid reader, and it seemed that this Fire was a device which could do it all--store my eBooks, games, pics, etc., and even let me watch movies thanks to my Prime membership. WRONG. I did watch one movie, but since then I haven't been able to download another, even after I removed the first movie. On my laptop Amazon tells me I'm downloading the movie, but when I go to watch it on the Fire I'm told that I can't watch the movie because I don't have an Internet connection. Frustrating. Also, Amazon slams you with ads on this device. I've played Hungry Shark Evolution on my Samsung phone and on the RCA tablet, and I never had to deal with all these ads almost every time I lose a life. When I'm playing games I often don't have an Internet connection, so Amazon is apparently using a hefty chunk of my little 8 gigs of storage to store all those ads instead of letting meuse it for what I want to store. Also, when I play Hungry Shark Amazon's menu bar keeps popping up on the right side of my screen, causing me to hit it inadvertently, which takes me back to the startup screen and closes my game AND makes me lose my progress. Unless I'm mistaken, there's no way to turn it off temporarily or reposition it. Oh, and when I read the description on Amazon it led me to believe I'd be able to get games from Google Play, but you can ONLY get games from Amazon, and believe me: The games and apps at Amazon are nowhere near as good or plentiful as the games and apps at Google Play. So, I'm kicking myself for not spending a little bit more for a Samsung tablet, which I know would have made me happy. My advice to you is: DON'T BUY THE KINDLE FIRE HD 7 7&#34; 4TH GEN. I don't think it's worth $50, but I KNOW it's not worth $100.",24/06/2015,0

My son has an IPad Mini.  I am usually an android person but I have paid for the same games for both devices so they wouldn't fight over which tablet to play with.  The Kindle requires a WiFi connection for most games to work.  For example, I purchased SpongeBob Moves In on both devices.  The IPad Mini is able to play the game without internet while the Kindle cannot.  Furthermore, the device recently froze up.  I called Customer Service and did the hard reboot as suggested.  Nothing works.  It comes on and goes to the &#34;Kindle Fire&#34; screen and that's it.  Customer Service states that it is the battery but they do not service these devices and since my Kindle is 4 months past my 1 year warranty, they could only offer a discount for a new Kindle.  I went online and purchased a new battery and had my husband change it out.  It still does the same thing.  In conclusion, if you want to purchase a product that lasts about a year then this product is cool but be sure to buy the extra warranty.  Personally, I won't be purchasing another Kindle product.  This was my second Kindle.  Amazon doesn't stand behind their products in my opinion.  If you do some research online, I'm not the only one that has had these same issues.",23/06/2015,0

It has ridiculously awesome battery life but it was finally time for a new tablet since I lost mine in an airport.<br /><br />A good tablet but seriously lacking. The battery life is abysmal. It's supposed to have 10 hours of battery life but in the 2 weeks I've had the fire, it will lose 30% in just an hour. I charged it and left it unplugged overnight and lost 60% battery before waking up the next day. I have it set to all the available power saving features.  The cameras for a 2014 device are just terrible. The front camera is so bad it's a joke. My galaxy s4 from 2013 has much better quality on both cameras. There is no flash on the back camera so you better hope you have great lighting for pictures and don't need a flashlight when holding the fire. It's very disappointing the wireless card does not use the faster 5 Ghz speeds from modern routers. If you have a fast wireless N or AC router, you will not be getting the speeds you should. This is a modified android device and I find it insulting you can't use the Google Play store to download all of the very same apps you've already paid for that are available on Amazon's store. The amount of apps approved for use on the Amazon store is also insulting. Their music and video choices are amongst the best in the industry but their app store is laughable. You can't even use Instagram, a major social media app!<br /><br />I must note that I signed up to develop on the Fire OS 5.0 which is also a modified version of Google's Android lollipop. Whatever is going  on in this version of the OS for battery should also be on all current versions of the fire. The battery life has improved so much it's ridiculous. You can leave it alone for 2 days and still expect about 70% battery to be available. Also, this version while probably not the final version, looks exactly like EVERY Android tablet with lollipop 5+ in existence. So, if they are going to keep this skin it should also support Google apps and the play store.",23/06/2015,0

Tried contacting Amazon and they were of little help. I had to rent a computer to contact Amazon since my Fire was of no use.

The subsequent books don't show a progress bar, so you aren't aware if the book is downloading or not.

FireOS is a version of Android that takes all the Google parts out and tries to redirect you to Amazon substitutes. Unfortunately, the Amazon versions are nowhere near as good. Use Google Apps? You're out of luck. Want something in the Play Store? Too bad. Want a webbrowser besides the hopelessly buggy Silk Browser? Good luck with that. You can sideload some apps if you are technically proficient, but for others, you are out of luck.  As for the children, Amazon's FreeTime is a terrible implementation of a good idea. The setup is designed for small children, so that you can limit screen time and keep them off the internet. While Amazon claims to have a &#34;Teen mode&#34;, this is the exact same FreeTime for six year olds, just with a different interface. You can't let your children use a web browser. You can't let your children use side loaded apps. (I really wanted my children to use MIT App Inventor, which isn't in the Amazon App Store.) Why? Because Amazon said so.  If you like Amazon and you want something well integrated into the Amazon world, then the Fire HD 7 is a nice tablet. If you want something for a preschooler, FreeTime works well. Otherwise, you'll be a lot happier with a real Android tablet.  Update: ***I LOVE the new Amazon Shop Tab.

I say &#34;help&#34; because it took 5 people to answer my question. My question was, &#34;Can I update apps in the freetime profile that are not on the parental profile&#34;. Short and simple, the answer is, No.<br /><br />We got the kindle for our son so that he could have a smart device but we would be able to monitor it and restrict his usage of it. I really like the timing profile and being able set time limits for how long and when he can play during the weekdays/weekends.<br /><br />But as time has worn on, we ran into issues. First, my son came to me one day saying that he wanted new apps. I obliged only to find that the kindle was out of memory. I was confused because he only had like 15 apps or so on his profile. As a matter of clarification, he is the only one that uses the kindle. After looking into it further, I noticed, THERE WERE TWO COPIES OF EVERY APP ON THE KINDLE! In order to create a freetime profile, you have to have a parental profile. You can only browse the appstore on the parental profile. When you find an app to download to add to the freetime profile, you click download and it downloads. What it also does is it uploads itself to the &#34;amazon cloud&#34;. This is where all your app purchases are kept in case you ever need to download them again easily. But here is the funny part. In order to add the new app to the freetime profile you have to download it from the amazon cloud. Therefore, the app that was just downloaded into the parental profile was for nothing. It has no purpose except to take up space.... At least this is what I thought until today.<br /><br />Prior to today, in order to clear out space so that my son could have more apps on his fire I deleted all the apps from the parental profile. This enabled us to get more then the 15 or so apps that he currently had. Granted, his kindle is only 8 gigs, but the only other option in memory is16 gigs which really isn't much more. Anyways, so today, I get a call from my wife telling me that one of his apps wasn't working and it was telling them that it had to be updated before it worked. They couldn't figure it out so they had to wait until I got home to figure it out.<br /><br />First thing I did was go to the freetime profile and check to see if there was any update apps option: None.<br /><br />Second thing, go to parental profile and check to see if I could update freetime profile apps from there: Nope.<br /><br />Third, contacted amazon chat help to try and figure out why I can't update the app that is in the freetime profile. It took about a half hour to get a straight answer. Only in the parental profile are the apps automatically updated. In order to update the apps in the freetime profile, you have to have the app already in the parental profile (which will automatically update itself). Then with that updated version you go into the freetime settings and remove, then readd the app that needs to be updated. If you have 5 apps that need to be updated, you have to unselect them all, then reselect them all to readd them to the freetime profile. After doing this, you have to go back into the freetime profile and redownload all the apps from the cloud. Along with this, any in app downloads need to be redownloaded as well. Some apps these days have over 500 megs of in app downloads after the initial app download.<br /><br />So when it all comes down to it, the kindle doesn't have enough space, the freetime at first glance looks great, but it has a ton of flaws, and the double app thing really bothers me. When it comes down to it, unless they do some serious software changes, my confidence in using their app is shattered. Time to look into other devices.",11/06/2015,0

Despite how terrible I find it to actually use, I can see that for many people that price point would make it possible to even get a tablet. If you have need of a tablet and all you can afford is $100, this is probably a good choice for you.<br /><br />With that out of the way, this thing basically sits on my shelf occasionally serving as a Spotify player. It's too irritating to use for most any other purpose. Visually, the interface is jarring. I often can't easily find the information/widget I'm looking for. Then there's other times when two widgets with the same functionality are on the screen at the same time, taking up extra space and incurring a weird sort of cognitive disruption from the redundancy. The scanner has poor sensitivity and often misregisters where my finger has touched. Many seemingly basic apps are laggy, leading me to think the processor is underpowered. The batter life plain sucks. If fully charged I leave it sit for two days, it's dead when I go to use it. I can let my laptop sit sleeping for a week and it's still got charge when I pick it up.<br /><br />Overall it's just a pain to use. The whole appeal of the tablet touch interface is that you don't really notice it. You just get absorbed into the process of using it. This is the complete opposite. There's friction nearly every step of the way. The layout, the clunky graphics, the laggy, unresponsive screen, and the lack of Google Play store access means you're stuck with a limited selection of mostly crappy apps.<br /><br />If you can afford anything better, go for it.",8/06/2015,0

I haven't found an easy way to access Google. I, somehow, turned on some parental filters. I have no children, no need for this, and don't know how I got to this screen, or why it says I turned on this feature. I could find no way to undo or cancel it. Nor could I find how to exit this screen except by turning off my Fire, waiting awhile, and turning it back on again. I still don't know how to get to this screen. I had difficulty in getting it to recognize me and open up it's features when I first turned it on. I stumbled my way in. I don't know why it accepted me the next time I turned it on when it didn't the first time. No paper instructions so I couldn't get any help about how to do this, or use other features, until I got in to read instructions on screen. A paper &#34;how to&#34; and &#34;what you need to do first&#34; included in the box would have been more helpful. Apparently you assume everyone knows how to use current electronic devices. Some of us old folks don't. I've never had a smart phone, or tablet, or anything else that would have clued me in. This Kindle is my first. It now usually takes me to my local library screen even when I don't want to got there. That just comes up. Accessing electronic media at the library is one of the reasons I bought this. I think, with further help from a librarian, I'll be able to do this. I downloaded some books that told they had downloaded. They're not on my Kindle. The only book that is is a dictionary that I didn't download so I'm guessing you folks did it. Thanks. Nice to have. I think the books I downloaded are in cloud limbo and will show when I figure out how to set up my email IP link. I discovered you've assigned me a new email address. I didn't know I needed a different one. But I'm glad I discovered where where to find it--after a couple of tries. I don't know which one, my normal email address that I get me email at, or they new one that maybe I'll get email at. (I don't know since I haven't been able to connect.) Or if I need to connect both. I haven't found information on what I need to do. Where is it? So currently I don't think I can buy anything because I don't trust that I'll get it on my Kindle Fire. I'm not unintelligent, but, I am electronic device challenged. I also can't make the screen change between vertical or horizontal orientation, when I want to, all of the time--or keep it from flipping back by itself. I see apps I don't use, but, I assume many others do, or you wouldn't have included them. I don't think I've tried to download any except an app that will let me order from Amazon.com.  I couldn't tell if I needed to download an Amazon app, if it came included, or if I was successful when I tried to download it. Nothing said it's now downloaded and I don't see it listed with other apps. Should I, or is it part of the architecture that I'm assumed to know about? I want to read books on my Kindle but so far cannot. I have some trouble getting to, or back to (if I've slipped out), a screen I want displayed. Some places it's easy to go back or forward. Some place this seems to not be doable. I'm assuming that this device is designed to allow a user to back out to a previous screen. It is not always easy to see how. It's also difficult, sometimes, to get from one screen to another. It was, for example, difficult to do so when setting up my link to my local library--for the reference librarian at the library doing it for me.I knew this was beyond my capabilities. I also discovered that the battery wears down at a prodigious rate when it is turned off. I assume this is due to some housekeeping function. I now leave it attached to an outside power source when not in use. I find the symbols of where to take it (what function) somewhat opaque. I'm learning them so eventually I don't expect this to be a problem. Navigating between I expect to continue to be a problem. Sometimes the Kindle goes where it wants to take me, not where I want to take it. This is more of a list than you expected. I'll stop now. I rated it 2 instead of 1 because I assume my ignorance is a large part of my problem. I frequently don't find the &#34;help&#34; pages very helpful. I don't know how to interpret the words often. I know it's clear in the mind of the writer, but I can't always tell what was meant or how to implement the instructions. If you've got customer service reps who can walk me through how to use my Kindle I'd appreciate it. Addendum: Looking at the manual again after posting I figured some more of it. Not enough yet but some more of it. I'm sure most of you will have less trouble than I am.",6/06/2015,0

From a hardware perspective it's okay, but amazon's app store leaves little choice and most of the apps are useless and even out-dated. Amazon's keyboard stinks, it's slow and constantly collapses in the middle of typing, often forcing me to re-open the app. The silk browser is just as midbendingly awful. It too is slow, only let's you open 8 tabs, doesn't function with plugins etc, and of course, amazon's app store doesn't even have firefox or chrome. The notifications suck, the only way you know you have a notification is by going and rolling down the top bar. The only way i even got by using this thing was when it was rooted, but now that is impossible because amazon's ADB is incompatible with windows 8, and a forced update undid my root.<br /><br />I'll give it 2 stars for being a kindle, it does that just fine, but so does the paper white.

The one I originally purchased in Nov'14 suddenly died in May'15. So I called Amazon customer service, and they sent me a replacement. Unfortunately, it is their policy to only send refurbished units under the 1yr warranty. When I received the 2nd Fire I noticed the battery was draining at an unusually fast rate even though I hadn't even opened any apps or anything. I was just trying to set it up, and I was losing about 1% every 2min. So I contacted customer service again, and they told me to reset it, and call back if I had another other problems. Well the following morning, my son played on the tablet for 1hr, and in that time the battery went from 100% to 74%. I called customer service again, and they once again sent me another refurbished Fire HD 7. Not only does this tablet lose charge of a rate of about 20% an hour, but a few of the apps in FreeTime stopped opening. The screen would blink, and then either go back to the home screen, or open a completely different app. I called customer service yet again, and they advised me to do a factory reset, which seemed to solve the app issue (at least for now), but did nothing at all about the ridiculous battery drainage issue. The main reason, I wanted to keep this tablet was because my son loves the FreeTime feature, and so do I. But I've had enough of them sending these crappy refurbished units with terrible battery life. I guess I will just get my son an Ipad mini instead. I have an ipad myself, and have never had any of these issues. I will NEVER purchase another kindle or fire...nothing but a hassle.",1/06/2015,0

Amazon makes it UNAVOIDABLE to have to see vulgar, vile, lewd, graphic, CRIMINAL, CRUDE book covers and book titles that only child predators, pedophiles, and people who enjoy incest would want to look at or read. I have contacted Amazon several times about this issue and spent hours on the phone with their reps and received no help to remove inappropriate and unwanted content on my family's Kindle, and still have been told that there is nothing I can do about it. These are the current titles Amazon is recommending on my Paperwhite this weekend with graphic pictures of half-nude young girls in pigtails on the cover to go along with the following nasty titles:<br />- Stretching the Brat (young girl with pigtails on cover)<br />- Double Jail Bait Teamed (young girl with pigtails and school uniform on cover)<br />- Training Lil' Elise<br />- Moving a Little Heart (girl with pigtails and teddy bear on the cover)<br />- Spanked and Diapered<br />- Curves for Stepbrother (I don't even want to describe this cover to you)<br />- Angel's Enema<br />- Cream for Stepbrother (really?!)<br />- Nursing Nymphos<br />- The Marshall's Little Girl<br />and so many others, but that was just this weekend!<br /><br />And I assure you, I HAVE NEVER, nor has anyone in my household browsed or purchased books on these heinous subjects. I have young children, AND my Kindle is password protected.<br /><br />WHAT IS GOING ON WITH AMAZON THAT CUSTOMERS SHOULD HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS?! If this kind of stuff was found on the average person's computer, they could probably be prosecuted for child pornography. THAT'S how bad it is. Yet, Amazon has no qualms about subjecting it's customers with families to this perversion without the option to block it. It's absolutely ridiculous!<br /><br />I've purchased about 5 Kindles or more over theyears for my family, and as gifts, and so many other items from Amazon. I am becoming SO disappointed and disgusted in Amazon due to this experience. It is obviously NOT a family-friendly company. I'm now sorry I bought my child a Kindle Fire because she now can't even browse books to purchase because I have to worry about her seeing sick perversions on their shopping page. There is no setting to block this; only to block recommendations on the home screen. What sense does this make? Their reps claim that is has to do with browsing and purchase history, but that CANNOT be accurate, because we DO NOT and HAVE NOT browsed or purchased anything of this seriously demented nature or anything even close. Their systems dept. needs to seriously find their problems and issues and deal with them, because this feels like harassment.<br /><br />I also wonder why Amazon would sell or push ANY material involving underage sex, incest and all other criminally-crude content. That alone has me shocked and sickened, let-alone forcing us to have to view these titles and graphic book covers just to visit the store to make a purchase of a normal book!<br /><br />This needs to be addressed. I've been contacting them about this for weeks now, but have been ignored. Their rep reviewed my prior book purchases, which are mostly sci-fi, suspense and thrillers and couldn't figure out why I was getting these recommendations. So her bright solution to this matter, was to tell me to &#34;browse a bunch of kids titles&#34; to get this to change. Instead of getting rid of these vile things or offering a way to block them for their customers.<br /><br />It's funny, Amazon can block something they won't allow in a review, or allow someone to &#34;report abuse&#34; in a review, and block it, but I can't do the same with their recommendations that are repulsive and border on criminal. I find the content they're forcing on me abusive, and they are a telling me that it's too bad; I have to deal with it.Like it or not.

The apps that are allowed into store are somewhat useless and limiting. A very disappointing issue is the way most of what is available online for edification and entertainment is verboten since the browser doesn't allow for streaming unless it's Amazon Prime or Amazon movies.

We got it at a great price, and I can see where it would be a fine tablet for people who only use Amazon for their electronic entertainment.  But for us, it was clear within 24 hours that we were going to have to return it.<br /><br />Some background: Our older daughter has had a Nook HD tablet for a few years now, but most of her reading has been done on the Kindle app so we thought we would go with a Kindle Fire for our younger daughter now that she is old enough for her own tablet.<br /><br />With the Nook, we could shop around for apps -- we could buy Android apps from the Barnes and Noble website or Google Play, and either way they would run (providing we had the right version on Android, of course).<br /><br />Not so with the Kindle -- the selection of apps is severely limited since we can only go through the Kindle app store and not Google Play at all.  Plus,we were so disappointed to find out that several of my daughter's favorite Android games were incompatible with Amazon's proprietary version of Android.  Software developers consider their version of Android to be so different that it is it's own category of operating system.<br /><br />Plus, we found the Fire to be very glitchy in terms of downloading and installing books/apps -- it would say that something had been downloaded, but it wasn't _really_ all the way done, and so when we tried to open something, it would freeze part way through.  This would happen several times before we could finally get things to open consistently.  Rebooting didn't really help.  It was especially bad on the kids' profiles under the Free Time app.  Initially I was excited about Free Time, but I discovered that everything has to be downloaded and set-up twice... once under the adult profile and the once under Free Time.  That, combined with the glitchiness, meant it was very slooooow going to get this set up.<br /><br />We also found the lack of external buttons VERY frustrating.  My daughter has read many books using the Kindle app on her sister's tablet, but when she was reading books on the Fire, we had a lot of trouble finding a way to EXIT the reading app.  The menu just wouldn't appear when we swiped... And there are no external buttons to allow the user to force a return to the home screen...So we'd just be trapped in the book, alternately trying swipes from the top, bottom, sides, etc.<br /><br />Plus, the battery would drain very quickly (at 40% brightness on the screen, not running video or anything graphics intensive, and it was still dropping about 15% per hour).<br /><br />I really love shopping on Amazon... I wanted to like this tablet, truly!  But we're returning it to go get a different tablet, and then we'll just download the Kindle app on it for reading the books we love.",24/05/2015,0

I'm used to being able to turn my smart phone on by tapping the screen. I can't do that with the Kindle fire. Maybe I'll get past this as I've only had it for a few weeks, but for now it's annoying and inconvenient. Navigating around the Kindle Fire is also a source of frustration. When my son is looking at a book on Freetime, or I'm playing a game, it takes some work tapping on the screen, to get the navigation options to come up. Sometimes as I'm tapping , trying to get the navigation options to display, it scrolls through several pages of a book I'm reading before I can get back to the home screen. This messes up the location that Kindle stores as my past read page. I wish the books my son downloads through freetime would be stored on Cloud, but it could be an App problem. I'd also like to be able to see a list of the books he's downloaded, rather than having to scroll through all of the available books hoping to find them so I can remove them from the device. This is mostly because of such little store space on the device. Also, they kind of trick people with the &#34;free offers&#34;. They're actually annoying ads that slow down apps and show up when you turn it on. I should have known when there was nothing about what the free offers are in the description.

To be fair, this review is for users who is looking to upgrade from an old Android tablet to Fire. I have a Kindle Paperwhite, so I'm one of the users looking for a tablet upgrade, but I can tell you it is not a good idea. Since it's Android based I was expecting at least close to other Android tablets, I have owned 3 other Android tablets and from my experience, Fire HD 7 is very feature-limited comparing to them. Here are the pros and cons from my perspective:  Pros: - Good hardware spec - Easy to use interface to learn - Built-in amazon account integration - Good tablet for the money  Cons: - Unfamiliar Andriod interface - Amazon App store has limited apps comparing to PlayStore. Essential apps like all-in-one tools are not in the Amazon app store - App crashes. Apps like Trulia and Zillow crashes all the time. I've tried force-stop the app, clearing cache, and resetting the Fire, but nothing helped - A bit bulky and heavy for current gen tablets  All in all, it's a good tablet for Kindle users or new tablet user, but look elsewhere if you are looking for a tablet upgrade. I'm kind of disappointed on the Fire Andriod OS, as I had high hope on Fire HD 7.  As some may wonder, is rooting the FireHD7 the answer? For me, yes, definitely. Although I can understand why Amazon chose to develop the Fire Andriod OS, but I think it's a waste of hardware potential and OS stability in doing so. For this reason, I will be rooting my Kindle Fire HD 7 and installing a Custom Andriod ROM. Even though it will mean loosing the support service, it will still be worth it because I can still use Kindle app to read my books while utilizing the tablet as well as the Andriod OS' full potential.",18/05/2015,0

The HDX 7 has great power and volume control locations. Not sure why the keep changing around, but this model is just bad in this regard.

But, that was a mistake.  I know that electronics all have a short life-span, but this is a joke.  The hardware works fine, but nothing works on the actual device anymore. my apps all require updates that the tablet can not provide.  There hasn't been a hardware update in who knows how long.  To make matters worse, it's not just 3rd party Apps that don't work.  I can't even listen to Amazon PRIME music on my 1st Generation Fire.  I can't download an App to operate my Amazon Echo (an older Kindle Fire would be the idea 'control pad' for Echo).  If being an early adopter of Amazon products just means you are going to be left behind and not able to continue to use their products, I'm just going to buy something else.  My wife's iPad (that is older than the Kindle Fire) has the ability to do everything my Fire cannot.  I just don't see the point in spending less money on an inferior product if it's going to last for a shorter period of time, and I'll just have to buy something new anyway.",15/05/2015,0

If you are buying this to read books, do very light internet browsing and/or listen to audiobooks, consider my rating 5 stars.  However, if you are looking for something like a bigger version of your Android phone, look elsewhere.  The primary reason for only 3 stars (and why i returned it) is b/c you are very much forced to remain primarily within the Amazon world (and again, if that's what you want, 5 stars).  You cannot install or gain access to Google Play Services in anyway so if you wanted to play clash of clans or get any of your other Android apps (that aren't in Amazon's AppStore), you can't. Some apps can be sideloaded but even then, you can't load your backed up data from Google.

We had been trying to stream Netflix and Amazon Prime movies/TV shows to our HD TV - and getting frustrated in the process. The Netflix app often crashed, or told us we needed a high-speed connection to make it work (we have the fasted Internet connection possible for residents - 50Mbps). Plus, the shows frequently were so pixelated and clunky that we had to restart the Kindle frequently. Often, the episode just buffered endlessly.   We moved the cable modem and wireless to within 15 feet of the Kindle, thinking that may be helpful. It wasn't.   So we bought an Apple TV device - and were floored by the Blu-ray quality of the images. No buffering. No Netflax app crashes. The Apple TV device absolutely blew away the Kindle HD we were using.   My assessment is that the Kindle Fire HD (First Gen) wasn't built for speed, didn't have a fast enough processor, and had problems with wi-fi.   If you have been having rough, choppy streaming, slow connections, frequent app crashes, or buffering issues, it's likely because your Kindle Fire HD isn't up to the task. Buy an Apple TV device and enjoy super high-quality streaming without a hitch - in full surround sound.   I'll never go back to the Kindle Fire again - no matter what the generation. It's not good for streaming. We don't read books on it. And music doesn't sound all that great. In short, what's the point of having the Kindle Fire HD?   ___  I bought the first generation Kindle Fire HD with the 7in screen. For the most part, it's operated okay - if a little slow and fussy at times. (More about that in a minute.)  I was going to buy the latest generation of the Fire HD 7in. But the availability reminds me of the old joke about Henry Ford making cars back in the day: &#34;You can have any color you want, as long as it's black.&#34;  That's the case here.  Amazon advertises a multitude of colors and options. Yet, when Itry to select a 16GB model in any color than black, I'm switched to an 8GB model or 6in screen model. Or, when I try to select the option of no advertising messages I'm shoved into the color black or 6in screen model. When it comes to those sponsored ads, what difference does it make what color or GB memory size I select?  I've been considering getting a new tablet, one with more memory or in other colors. I've kicked around an iPad, another Kindle, or a Samsung.  The fact that ordering the Kindle in any color other than black or size other than 8GB is near to impossible may tip the scale for me.  The Kindle Fire is okay. But I've owned iPads before and they're more powerful and now - thanks to the iPad Mini - just as light or lighter.  We use our Kindle Fire HD 7in for streaming Netflix or Amazon Prime movies/episodes. I've had problems keeping TV episodes on my Kindle Fire HD because Amazon keeps removing them. And I'm not talking about stuff I download from Prime. I'm talking about stuff I've paid for, that I allegedly &#34;own.&#34; It sometimes turns up missing. I'd have to contact Amazon and explain what's going on. The rep would apologize and download it again for me. Later, it would disappear again.  Silk is an okay browser. But it's no Google. Plus, there are constant questions from the apps about how we want it to proceed.  The first gen Fire HD 7 was a great entry-level tablet for streaming stuff. But it's not all that good for reading (Paperwhite is superior for that purpose), and the battery runs out pretty quickly. We're constantly charging it - with a very short cord that makes using it while charging it difficult.  I may have taken up Amazon on their $99 price for a new HD 7. But, as I wrote, it's 8GB and black (with special offers) or nothing. There's so little memory available to users that the 8GB is not even close to what we'd need. Plus, I would have liked to have had more color choices than black.  I guess I'll try iPad or Samsung for my nexttablet.  That's not a slight against the Kindle. It's been fairly reliable for what we use it for. But I think we need to try something new - even if it does cost 2-3 times more. You get what you pay for.",10/05/2015,0

I really can't believe it.  Since they had a sale on their own product they now use that as an excuse to show ads.  &#34;Here Mom!  Happy Mothers Day! Just swipe right past that commercial on to the front screen.  Oh and you can't personalize the backgrounds.  Or if you can, hell if I can figure out how without consulting multiple boards&#34;<br /><br />2) Even worse than ads... this is not easy to navigate.  I got this for me mom and quickly realized that she would not be able to figure it out.  I had to sit at the laptop and try to find help screens to figure out how to navigate this thing.  And I didn't find much help.  This is complicated by the ads and the content pushing which is overboard.<br /><br />My 13-year-old nephew would view youtube all day on this and probably love this.

Sideloaded Dropbox, Viber and other google apps such as Google Drive. Fairly easy to set up. Not able to edit google documents though. Need to find a way around it :-) 4.

Even customer service is stumped at this point. If it were only one of the 3 kindles I would assume it was a glitch, but all 3 kindles are having the same issue.  The last factory reset gave us 1 week of usage (less than 5 hours of actual playtime).  The only games played at this point are the games provided by the Kindle FreeTime Unlimited subscription we have.

I bought it so that we could use all three of our favorite video services - Amazon Prime, Netflix and Vudu, but Vudo (Ultra Violet movies) are not supported on the Fire HD.  I'm afraid if I had known that, it would have been a deal breaker.  The other drawback is that unlike most android devices, there is no place to add more memory.  My daughter has a cheap android tablet that was less than half what the Fire cost, but I was able to add a 32 gb mini SD so that I could put a lot of content on it. It really works well except for the fact that it couldn't get Amazon Prime movies, and it has an inferior camera.  That's why I bought the Fire, but even though the Fire gives me Amazon Prime and a better camera, it doesn't give me other things that were important to me.  So, if I want to have it all, I have to either have two different tablets, or I have to buy an ipad.The other thing that really bugs me is that every time you turn it on, it comes up with a new ad on the home screen.

I'd like to use it occassionally for streaming and every one has some new gizmo that Amazon sells you. I just ordered an HDMI adapter for this 4th generation Kindle Fire and we'll see what happens. Last Kindle we had to get a dongle device for miracasting. If Amazon hopes to sell me any more of their products then they need to put the micro HDMI jack back on their Kindles like the HDX we bought two devices ago. Good value for the money but I'd rather pay a tad more and have what I need. Okay I've used it for a week and also got the HDMI adaptor for this unit and it connects to tv fine and allows streaming from Kindle to tv. It's a little slower connecting to web pages on the internet verus our last two Kindles and you actually only get about 5GB of useable storage so people may want to consider the 16GB Kindle. Overall I bumped it up from a three to a four but wouldn't give it a five because of lacking HDMI micro jack and slow browser.  OKAY UPDATE! I've now used this Kindle for over four months and this is the worst one out there. I constantly have to turn the unit off because it locks up and it's too slow connecting compared to my spouses and the one I gave up to my grandson. I would only get a 16GB unit at minimum.

I have had this since april of 2015, so 3 months later I have quite allot of time invested into using this machine and feel I have enough insight to give this review. First week, great, works amazing. Month goes by and I see that its getting sluggish, I do everything I know to remedy this 1. Ensure I am cold booting and not putting the machine to sleep so to refresh the ram and system everyday 2. Keep it well charged ensuring all the parts inside have enough power to work at their optimum levels 3. Get the best system cleaner app I can to ensure nothing runs that doesn't need to and everythings cleared out every once in awhile while using it. This did not help. I keep from downloading anything really mostly just using a couple books for school and the internet browser. Tried a couple game but uninstall when it feels sluggish.  2 months later things are even worse than ever. I do a factory reset after nothing works and the machine still runs like garbage. My cousins Nexus 7 2010 works better than this piece of trash. But I feel that after a couple more updates things might improve, maybe its a software issue. Well a couple updates later, 3 months later I am here to tell you this thing is a piece of trash. Is it worth buying? Sure, but not for what they are asking for. This is a $60-$80 machine at best. DO NOT BUY THIS!!! I am very disappointed in amazon and I regret this purchase everyday. Todays inspiring review update is from the system completely crashing on me while pausing a youtube video and stepping away for a moment. Upon returning the machine was completely unresponsive and I had to hold the power button to turn it off, then it wouldnt turn on and I got a message that the system crashed and recommended restoring factory setting -_- quad core, 1gb ram my ass.

However, there are some big problems with it. it counts as an android device, but you can't get apps off google play. It's very frustrating, because you can only get apps that amazon lets you get.

Really there is a lot of improvement that needs to happen before I like this. Additionally, I paid for 8GB of space, and got 5. Actually, less then 5 because of the space taken up by the things already installed. And the advertisements you get when you boot up are EXTREMELY annoying.

For instance, try getting a playlist imported from iTunes with Amazon Music Importer (of which only 250 songs are free to upload).  You can't - at least not preserving the order of the playlist (both Google and Microsoft have had apps that do this and keep things in tact for years - where has Amazon been?).  The apps that are available via Amazon's app store are only a smidgen of what is available in Google's Play Store.  And cloud storage is what Amazon is boasting about?

For the price I paid its very hard to beat. The one thing I don't like about it is the way the UI works. There is no home button like on an apple device, so learning to use it takes some hunting around. It does have child profiles which is a bonus, but enabling that functionality further frustrates navigation. Just logging off one profile and onto another is not intuitive at all. You can log off the child profiles but there is no log off from the non-child profiles, you just lock the device, wake it up and then select the profile icon for the main user and then are presented with the other profiles as options. Very counter-intuitive. It would be better to have all profiles presented on the unlock screen. To Amazon's credit, the device pulled my kids profiles off my FireTV account with a single question/answer. Besides the UI issues which one can eventually learn, the device has excellent sound (stereo too), excellent screen resolution and color and snappy performance for games, video, browsing and other functions. I streamed a movie from my Prime account and it started instantly and ran smoothly and I have an older router and many wireless devices. I would give it 5 stars were it not for the clunky UI navigation issues. I suspect Amazon is not done tinkering with it and will probably introduce nav improvements.

Each and every time that either I or my daughter turns on the Kindle Fire HD, we get an ad that is very easy to click on. This is definitely not good for a young person who might take some time understanding what to click on. Users are not able to customize their interface very much. For example, I cannot put my favorite apps or videos or website on the home screen. Nor can users download apps from anywhere but Amazon, which really cuts down on the choices. The wi-fi is painfully slow at times. All the other wi-fi devices in our home work perfectly well, but the Kindle Fire HD creeps along, struggling to download apps and load webpages. Lastly, the battery life is just awful. We need to charge it after just about every use. This tablet cannot handle decent-sized games or many other apps.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this tablet is a fun diversion for my four-year-old daughter. There are a few free games that we have found.

Pure toy for them with of course computer/tablet skills learning.  Tablets seem to do everything that they claim and as an adult function great.  2 issues however.  First, both original units charging ports went bad within 2 months.  For a product that you need to constantly charge day in day out this is not something that should fail.  Looking further into it this is a common issue with these units.  Was replaced and received new tablets.  Second, broken screen.  My son dropped his tablet and broke his screen (anybody who owns a phone or tablet knows this happens).  This is not covered by warranty (which i never asked for that BTW, but was told several times by amazon support) and amazon does not offer any support for a replacement/repair.  I was simply looking for a replacement screen to purchase and either replace myself or get replaced.  This I find confusing considering that this is a common issue in todays phone/tablet world with touch screens?  They will offer you a replacement tablet at a so called &#34;reduced rate&#34;, but do not support their product with replacement or repair.  I guess you get what you payed for and amazon believes that these things are very disposable?  Nice job amazon!  So the moral is to do your research on everything before purchasing.

First off, I knew I should have gone with the larger size, but I tried to save a little money and go with the 8GB.

Not to mention that as I am writing this, a new message popped up saying the game it was trying to install is 1.50GB and I only have 1.15GB remaining while behind the message it clearly says 1.56GB free in the storage settings. Regardless of of the .35 difference.. 3.5 + 1.56 does NOT equal 8GB.. not to mention that the apps I installed equaled to less than 2GB... VERY disappointed that this Fire does not have the space it is supposed to have and is very inconsistent with the storage it does have. I'd like to also point out that I went in and deleted apps I installed and it went from saying my used space was 3.50 to 3.81 and my free space went from 1.50 to 1.25 AFTER I deleted content from the device!  EDIT: I went back and restored the Kindle to factory defaults. I have done absolutely nothing to the device except turn it on and make sure the software was up to date and I am showing that I have 4.28GB of free space. This is only half of what it should be. Of course, customer service said that the other half is taken up by the OS, but then it should be advertised as 4GB because that is all the user is getting.

But they are not. In my opinion, the Fire HD is no better as a reader and no more useable as a tablet than my old Kindle Fire. I did sideload several apps immediately after receiving the device, including YouTube, but that app any many others require Google Services which is not supported by the OS. I was able to sideload Flash so that I could sideload the Closeli app for a camera (bought the camera through Amazon but the app is not available in the Amazon store).  Honestly, I knew the device would come with the Fire OS but thought they might have become a bit more progressive.

If you're looking for a truly full featured tablet experience, you would be better served looking at an iPad or a more expensive Android device running a proper version of the operating system.<br /><br />This is device that's defined in many ways by what you can't do. You can't download apps from the Google Play store. There isn't a default Youtube app. There's relatively poor support for common third-party services like Dropbox, and accessing Google services is either impossible or requires workarounds. You can't even use and login to Chrome without going through a process that's likely to seem daunting to non-technical users. And if you are one of those technical users, don't expect to be able to root a 4th gen Fire to turn it into a proper Android device. It's not happening.<br /><br />That said, the Fire is competent in its own little niche. The device pops out of sleep quickly and Fire OS is a smooth and fairly seamless experience. I haven't had any crashes or other oddities that diminish the experience. Unsurprisingly, it works flawlessly if you're mainly interested in making use of Amazon services like Prime streaming or Kindle books. Amazon's app store has only a fraction of the apps that are available on Google Play (and many popular or common ones are missing), but the selection isn't terrible and there's a good mix of software for most basic needs.<br /><br />The hardware itself ranges from &#34;pretty good&#34; to &#34;god awful.&#34; The quad core processor, at this price point, is a nice piece of kit. It's good enough to make the Fire HD feel snappier and more responsive than a cheap budget table has any right to be. The screen is a high point as well. The pixel density on the 7&#34; version isn't spectacular, but it looks fine and the overall quality is good. The case is cheap feeling plastic with a textured matte finish. It's not terrible, but you'll be disappointed if you're used to higher quality tablets or phones. The cameras are so terrible that they border on useless. They're acceptable (barely) if you only intend to use them for video chat, but expect photo quality that's on par with ten year old feature phones. They're that bad.<br /><br />On the whole, the Fire HD is decidedly unimpressive. It feels like there's a great budget device here, but the limitations mean that it never crosses over that magical line that turns it into a great value. You get exactly what you pay for, and at this price that's fine. Just don't expect to be blown away or to receive a device that'll give tablets costing twice as much a run for their money.",24/04/2015,0

I mean, Amazon's tablets seem to be immensely popular, while virtually no one I've spoken to locally even knows that the Fire TV is, so surely these tablets are solid, right? Well, while I've only had the Fire HD 7 for a day, and I know that the right software update could make a ton of difference in the future, this review is based on my initial experience with the device, and that experience is anything but positive.<br /><br />Now, for the pluses and minuses:<br /><br />+ The display, while not full HD, is actually quite nice.<br /><br />- Getting a movie that you downloaded over Wi-Fi to play offline isn't as intuitive as it should be. Unless I'm doing something wrong, launching a movie offline when you've already downloaded it seems to only work from the carousel. Trying to play it anywhere else just generates an error, and even launching from the carousel makes it seem like the device is locked up. (There's no indication that it's loading the movie. The UI just becomes completely unresponsive until playback begins. This isn't the case on Fire TV.)<br />- Haptic feedback would've been nice. The UI just feels lifeless and lacks sufficient feedback to your input, in my opinion.<br />- The carousel UI is a colossal waste of space.<br />- The UI generally just needs more context menus (ideally by long-pressing).<br />- These tablets don't have nearly enough storage for what they are. They should've had SD card support. Sure, I don't *have* to download HD versions of my movies to watch offline, but I should have the option to do so, because I bought HD movies in order to watch them in HD. Being able to only download three HD movies onto this thing (16 GB version - thank God I didn't settle for the 8 GB version) before it's too full for another download is just ridiculous. Speaking of which, the menu for managing storage shouldn't be buried in settings. You should be able to long-press on a movie from anywhere on the UI and delete it.<br /><br />Yes, I understand that Fire TV is plugged in and isn't relying on battery power, but there's no reason for the Fire tablet experience to be this much worse than the Fire TV experience. I'll update my review if things improve in the future, but I can't help but feel that the experience simply won't get that much better. While I realize that it'd be at the expense of app compatibility, I honestly wish that Amazon would dump Android and work with something more lightweight for the underlying OS. This thing feels like an Android tablet...and not an especially good one.able to long-press on a movie from anywhere on the UI and delete it.<br /><br />Yes, I understand that Fire TV is plugged in and isn't relying on battery power, but there's no reason for the Fire tablet experience to be this much worse than the Fire TV experience.

It's already giving me warnings that it's nearly full. I guess that's partially my fault for getting the 8GB version....but I never imagined i'd be able to nearly fill this thing with just a few children's apps. They shouldn't even sell the thing with this low of a capacity.   It's still very dodgy performance....sometimes it's speedy, but most of the time it's slow. Still take a ridiculous amount of time to download an app. THIS alone has cause both me and my daughter a great deal of frustration (kids aren't known to be that patient as it is).   The app selection is horrible for the child subscription service that's offered....free time unlimited?!? WHAT A JOKE...it's VERY limited. Majority of the apps are low low low quality. Very few truly educational apps. And once again...they take forever to download and install.   Another quirk is that some apps, even though they are child centric, still have to be installed from the adult profile. But the thing is...when you download it from the adult profile, and then add it to the kids profile, it appears that you have to redownload it. No clue WHAT that's about. So you ultimately have to wait twice as long now before you can finally allow your child to play the app.   The sluggishness of downloading apps means you really have to plan ahead and curate apps for your child way ahead of when they're going to actually play on the thing. This is very frustrating because the apps on the children's profile literally offer NO description of exactly what they are. So you have to select the app, WAIT for it to download...THEN open the app and determine if it's an app you even want or that your child will even enjoy! THIS is beyond frustrating and really really kills the enjoyment of the device for the parent and the child.   I really want to return this thing and purchase a table that has regular old Android OS on it. But despite it's many many many many flaws....mychild would have a fit if it wasn't around. Hopefully I can do a switcheroo on her but i'll have to find a green bumper case so she's none the wiser....well....she'll probably be wise to it VERY quick once she sees how much better it is.   I feel horrible that I recommended this thing to so many parents before I even owned one myself. That was definitely irresponsible of me :( ... It might explain some of the dirty looks i've been getting.    Original Review Below Here: Purchased this for the sole purpose of giving it to my toddler. Kid's mode is NOT at all what it's billed to be. The primary problem is that the app store is still fully accessible to the child and they'll spend more time download each and every app that they see instead of playing with the apps that you've installed for them. It's frustrating that there's no way to preview and see exactly what the app IS when you're in the kid's mode too. It also takes a ridiculous amount of time to download the apps! SO FRUSTRATING!  The next HUGE deal breaker is that you have to REPURCHASE apps you've already purchased from the Google Play Store. The same freaking apps! I have rebuy all these child focused apps that i'd already purchased for our little one to play with on my Android phone and tablet. This is beyond infuriating. Amazon really needs to come up with a way for their app store to cohabitate with the Google Play Store. No one should have to repurchase the same apps for the same platform simply because Amazon doesn't want to put the Google Play Store onto their devices. And no, I don't want to/shouldn't have to root my device just to do something that should be provided as an option.  Getting out of kid's mode is NOT intuitive or easy. You have to push the power button off and then back on to get to the lock screen, then select the adult profile you want to use.  It's a really sluggish device overall. The FireOS skin (i REFUSE to call it an operating system because it's simply a clunky skin on top of Android) is very unintuitive and slow. So you browse apps, touch the app, and then wait....and wait....and wait....and wait....for it to finally download. Oh yeah, no 5Ghz wifi band use here....only 2.4Ghz......  Everything is SO SLOW.

Within 6 months he managed to destroy it by taking off the case and dropping it numerous times.  He was really learning a lot using a tablet. I did want to get him another tablet but I was not going to buy another expensive iPad.  I kept seeing the Kindle Fire advertised so I thought I would give that a try.  Best decision ever!  Easy to use, picture quality is fantastic and because it comes in a case you cannot remove it is far less likely to shatter the screen.  It has been dropped several times with no damage. Great tablet for everyone and far less money than an iPad.",10/04/2015,1

OK for what it is, OS needs definite improvement.","I purchased this Kindle Fire HD for my 5 year-old daughter.  As an adult who can be safely considered a tech-geek, here are the pros and cons for normal folks:<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1. My daughter loves it.<br />2. The profile controls and Amazon FreeTime controls to restrict usage are detailed and really exemplary.<br />3. It's inexpensive.<br />4. Amazon FreeTime has a lot of games, videos, and apps.  The monthly fee is nominal.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1. The UI for main OS is so disjointed and ugly that I'd almost prefer it if it were simply command-line based.<br />2. The actual FreeTime UI is similarly disorganized, and definitely confusing for anyone who is the age of my daughter.  It just throws too much right in her face that she can't figure out where everything is.<br />3. My wife has difficulty figuring out how to navigate through the UI, so if there's a problem finding something or doing something, I'm the one that has to figure it out.  iOS, this is not.<br />4. The tablet stutters a non-trivial amount of time.  It also sometimes becomes unresponsive for short periods.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />The truth is that I'm not willing to hand my daughter an iPad that costs triple the price, no matter how well protected it is.  So, this is the next best thing at her age.  Amazon FreeTime is a good idea with great parental controls, but definitely needs more polish.  Amazon, please fix FireOS.  It's hideous.",10/04/2015,0

Bought this kindle last summer to watch movies on my nightshift when I work doubles, after about 4-5 months it started turning off by itself after I unlock screen, open apps, just randomly turning off. Sometimes I get an app to open and load but as soon as I touch the screen it turns off and does not restart. If I press the power button to turn it back on, it shows the Kindle Fire loading screen as always when you first turn it on then turns back off, can't even make it to the unlock screen. Finally after a few months of dealing with that and trying to reset my kindle, the problem continued. I baby my electronics, so I never overcharged my kindle, it doesn't make sense as to why it would suddenly give me such issues. I called tech support yesterday, they said I have 85 days left on my warranty so they'll send me a REFURBISHED version, guaranteeing I won't have any problems, and I just opened it up and already have a problem! The back is loose, the battery drains very fast and gets very hot after 2 minutes of use. About 1% of battery drain per minute. Where as my old kindle I fully charged last night, played a couple games, left on all night and is still at 95%. If I pay 160+$ for a 16gb kindle, and it craps out on me only less than half a yr after I buy it, I expect my money back OR a BRAND NEW KINDLE, not a refurbished piece of crap that seems ta be worse than my old kindle! Not sure if I wanna send my old one back to them. I think I'd rather deal with my old kindle constantly turning off when it wants and only way I get it back on is if I plug it in, rather than keep a crappy refurbished one that's absolutely NOT worth the 160$ I had spent on my original kindle in the first place.

I contacted Amazon about repair possibilities and they said: &#34;It??

I called the number provided and had to provide all sort of info only to have to be transferred to another department (a customer service pet peeve of mine.  They knew the problem why didn't they provide me a phone number to speak directly to the department that would handle this?). After going through everything, the customer rep said the broken screen would not be covered under warranty and the device would need to be replaced.  Amazon does not provide any to repair these devices. Since they knew that would be hard to hear, they provide a discount for the replacement; a discount so small that the price of a replacement was still significantly more expensive that the price of the tablet when I originally bought it.

So I filled out the evaluation after the chat and up popped a screen that said we would still like to talk to you about this.  So I put in my number and they called and said how can i help you.

I have folks on my block who have had their kindles for years and handed them down to their kids. I thought it was a good buy. I thought surely Amazon stands behind their homegrown products. The last tech told me the average life of electronics is 2-3 years, well then your warranty should be 2 years so I can enjoy the average not 1 year so you can keep me in a buying loop in perpetuity. I will not be buying any more kindles. I'm not sure any other product will be better and have been avoiding apple products, but I am going to try one and see if it lasts longer than 15 months.

The apps the store does have seemed to be forgotten about during updates as well and some things are outdated such as facebook and twitter and even amazon's web browser, Silk, appears to still have the old fashioned google which really makes the kindle feel old and I??e only had it for a couple of months.

I did take about 1.7GB of videos and used 1.86GB of games, but when I connected my Fire to a computer, the computer indicated that there were 782MB free out of 5.05GB!  Since 8GB was advertised, I expected it to say 782MB free of 8GB.  If you have your heart set on getting a Fire tablet, I recommend the 16GB version, but ultimately, I recommend the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4.  The strangest feature on the thing might be a glitch, is that when you plug it in and it's off, it automatically boots up.  The main reason I gave this a 3 star rating instead of a one or two star, is because of the handy feature that lets you drag your finger (or stylus) across the on-screen keyboard to type and despite other reviews, it has a good CPU speed.  Update: If you look at the storage section of the specifications, you will notice that it says: 8 GB (4.5 GB available to user) or 16 GB (11.6 GB available to user) of internal storage.  I do not think it would have been hard for amazon to put in a memory card slot for upgradable storage.",31/03/2015,0

Let's take this review step by step starting with the build-<br /><br />BUILD (7/10)<br /><br />So the device is wrapped in a layer of plastic with a strong glass for the screen. This plastic is not strong at all and is also a fingerprint magnet. This is why I took of some points. However, it claimed it could be dropped off of a car and not scratch and for the 4 months of abuse it's been through it has shown no signs of damage.<br /><br />APPS (4/10)<br /><br />The new fire runs off of a new Fire OS now and that means that it has a new app store.. now this app store is already lacking some of the bigger apps already (EX instagram, clash of clans etc.) But now even less because of the new OS. They said that more than 200 apps are added everyday but none really of my interests. I'm sure it will grow but for now it isn't very impressive.<br /><br />PERFORMANCE (8/10)<br /><br />Okay so it has a Quad Core processor in the device which makes it lightning fast and I really have to give it to Amazon on this one.. there is virtually no lag in regular everyday use. Also it has two Dolby graded speakers on the back (Speakers sound amazing some of the best I've heard on a tablet) also Amazon has included new &#34;Emoji&#34; characters to the keyboard a nice upgrade if you are into &#34;Emojing&#34;<br /><br />CAMERA (3/10)<br /><br />So one of the biggest new features it has is the new rear facing camera! This practically won me over. But then I got to use it... little did I know it is only a 2 MegaPixel camera!!!! It sucks!! It is one of the worst I have ever seen I will tell you, do NOT buy this if you are looking for a tablet with a good camera! (Same goes for the front facing camera as well it is no better)<br /><br />Now I've said enough bad things let's look at the cool features they addedthis time-<br /><br />- App collections<br />-&#34;Emojis&#34;<br />-nice crystal screen very bright and vibrant<br />-a little bit of customization but nothing exciting (no wallpapers etc)<br />-voice command<br />-Very Fast<br />-lots a bug fixes from the previous models<br />-one month free prime (at time of review)<br />-firefly<br /><br />Now for some disappointing cons-<br /><br />- no mayday on these models at this time<br />-bad cameras<br />-plastic shell<br />-lack of customizations<br />- only comes with 16 GB which is fine but it can get tight.<br /><br />So that is about it... would I recommend this to a friend... yeah... I probably would. Just not for the camera.<br /><br />(PS. Not much has changed about the reading experience it is still as good as the previous models)<br /><br />Hope this review helps you decide!<br /><br />The price is amazing, so yes I would recommend it ONLY if you think it suits your needs!<br /><br />Thanks for reading<br />- Sent from my Fire HD",29/03/2015,1

I got this one a few months ago and my husband is now using my first one, from a few generations back, almost exclusively to download, then read and simultaneously listen to books.<br /><br />I use this every night and very much like its versatility. I first check all my news sources, then read through Twitters posts, play a few games, and read books, all the while listening to classical music via the Pandora app. (The music stays on regardless of what else you're doing on the Kindle, unless you deliberately stop it.) There's an exception to that: now and then the Kindle -- for reasons entirely inexplicable to me -- makes the music cut out and I have to go to the app and restart it. (The sound quality, not incidentally, has improved some from my previous model as well.)<br /><br />Here and there other apps hang up as well, but not all that frequently. That's a defect of sorts, I guess, but it haven't been serious enough for me to contact Kindle support about it.<br /><br />Though I don't use the camera all the time, the front and back camera on this model (as opposed to just a front camera from my previous model) is a great improvement and now allows not just for Skype use but for regular picture-taking. The screen resolution is also excellent.<br /><br />I deliberately don't do email on the Kindle, and don't allow it to track my location. I also don't own a smartphone, and don't want one. But I'd very much miss my Kindle Fire HD if it were, for some reason, taken from me. Besides using it every night at home, I really like being able to take it with me to appointments, etc., when/where I know I'll have to sit and wait for a while. Though I'm still very much a paper-and-ink book person, it's so much easier to read a book with the Kindle in such circumstances -- and/or to dip into several books -- than to take one or more actual physical books along to wherever I'm going.<br /><br />That amazon is producing these sophisticated littlemachines and offering them for the relatively modest price they're asking is a boon, particularly to us non-Apple users.

First, and most important...the picture quality on here is not good. There is no flash, apparently, so you have to hold the tablet still for a few seconds longer than is necessary with a flash...And try to get the child you are photographing to hold still too...which makes that time either seem like an eternity, or just be impossible.<br /><br />Second complaint, no SD card. (Which I knew full well going into my purchase, so the 4 stars instead of 5 is all for the picture quality.) Don't get me wrong, there is space on here. I have apps, documents, a lot of music, books, all on this tablet. And I STILL have space. But...it would be nice to be able to plug an SD card in, and not have to worry about space.<br /><br />But, now, the GOOD. I use this tablet for blogging, social media, reading, and a game or two. Plus, I love listening to music and audio books. This tablet is all of that for me, and still small and lightweight enough to fit comfortably in my hands, and for me to be able to read on at night.<br /><br />I absolutely adore this device, and aside from the pictures not turning out well, it absolutely suits my needs.",27/03/2015,1

I've gotten nothing but disappointment from this device. It crashes a lot and can't run many of the apps that other android devices can. It even seems like when an app that I fall in love with does work, an update will cause it to crash and no one ever fixes it. The chat support transferred me a total of 10 times the first time I've had a simple audio issue and no one seemed to know what they were doing.<br /><br />I recently have gotten a problem will my kindle where it crashes and then repeatedly crashes again on the booting up window and I can't get the device to boot up until I plug it unto an outlet. This happened to me 4 times in a week. The first time it happened was when I was watching a movie on Netflix. When I'm at work and didn't bring my charger, it's impossible to fix the Kindle in that state. The support team decided to send me a refurbished kindle of my same generation but I'd rather just get a refund.<br /><br />Also, the hard-drive only has 5GB of space available from opening the box and this makes it impossible to keep many items on the device. Some apps in the app store are larger than this space. I couldn't even get Blizzard's new mobile card game to work on this device.<br /><br />I'll wait to see if the refurbished kindle will fix any of these problems and update my review then.",26/03/2015,0

I will be getting my new one in 2 days and if it works fine, then I'll be sending my current one back. I appreciate that Amazon turned around and decided to provide a solution this time.  I originally had the first version of the kindle and when I got this newer version as a Christmas gift, I found that this one is lighter to hold and the interface is better. Browsing on the web is definitely easier and has less complications. I mainly use my Kindle Fire to read books, and I like how it tells you the percentage and your reading speed. However, after 2 months of use, it started crashing randomly - meaning, I wouldn't be able to turn it on. The first time it happened, I thought the battery had died so I let it re-charge fully. The 2nd time happened after I knew that I had already charged it - I called customer support and they had me hold the power button down for 40 seconds and then eventually it came back on. I expressed my concerns that it was doing this after only 2 months of use and the girl's response was &#34;yeah we have found this happens with this version&#34; - I'm sorry, WTF? Since that time about a month ago, it has happened at least twice - the last time was today, after I had just used it 6 hours prior. I don't bother calling customer support or complaining to Amazon (although, maybe I will because if others are having the same issue, maybe they'll do something about it) because it seems like they don't care. To me, this is an issue, and I'm pretty sure that my device is still under warranty. I gave this 4 stars mainly because when it works, it works great - but this crashing thing is annoying. I'm glad that I have saved my old one - just in case my new one crashes completely and can't turn back on. I do not have many apps or even books downloaded - and no videos downloaded - I have the 16 mb, and there's no way that it's crashing because I have too many things on my device.

It's great tablet, but I have one OS design issue and a tech completities to discuss.<br /><br />I will say, before I get into the problems; The speakers are really amazing. I was able to share a youtube video with everyone around a 8' long table and everyone could here.<br /><br />The Kindle Fire Gen1 did everything I wanted it to until the battery died. Replacing it was the best option. The HUGE issue is a security issue. You can set a strong password on the Gen1. The HD 7uses a 4 digit numeric lock... completely lame. Security is supposed to get better over time, not worse. When I talked to Amazon to see if there why this was the case, it turns out that they had to deal with too many people who forgot their passwords. Reducing helpdesk calls really isn't a good justification for reducing security.<br /><br />I was able to save my data before the Gen1 to my computer's hard drive. But had huge problems getting HD 7 to communicate via the USB cable with my computer, and I do not envy anyone without professional computer technician abilites figuring the computer doesn't automatically detect the unit. Once I got this problem solved, moving the data over was very cool... with caveats.<br /><br />Books:<br /><br />The Kindle really wants you to push all your data out to the cloud (aka centralized server storage). It's the default. There's this little setting thing. If you moved over the entire contents of your books directory from your old device to your new device using a cable, the new Kindle will remember where you were in all your books, but when it pushes your books out to cloud storage your bookmarks are lost. If your wi-fi is turned on, the default location from which the tablet will be the cloud... so if your just reading turn off yoru wi-fi.<br /><br />Photos<br /><br />The Gen1  didn't have a photo browser so I had to use a third part photo viewing app. It was pretty cool, because you could organize your photos intofolders. Maybe Great Aunt Milly wants to see the wedding photos, but you're not too keen on her checking out the bachelor/bachelorette party photos, this worked pretty well. The HD 7 has a photo view standard, but it organizes by date, even if you move photos over from a device and create subfolders in the Photos directory. I haven't looked too much into this to see if this setting can be changed, but unless you're careful poor Milly's going to see way more than you want her too using the default settings.",25/03/2015,1

This is my third Kindle in 6 years and they just keep getting better and better.  To be fair the Kindle Fire is more of a tablet than an E-reader so you really can't compare.  My last Kindle was the Kindle Paper White which is incredible as an E-reader.  The screen on the Fire HD is extremely clear and crisp.  The sound is also very good.  I've watched a few movies on it already and couldn't be happier.  The only issue I have is that you get a fair amount of glare when watching a movie in a well lit room or if you have direct sunlight.  I've found this same problem on any tablet really so no surprise there.<br /><br />What sets this apart from other E-readers is that if what you're reading has pictures they are quite clear. f you use it for web browsing it is very responsive and easy to maneuver.,23/03/2015,1

I want to love this new version of the Kindle Fire but I absolutely cannot. I have the first version of Kindle Fire and loved it. It however, after 2 years is starting to die even with 50% battery life still on the charge. So my husband bought me this new one. The battery life was so bad, I returned the first one thinking it was a lemon. The second one arrived, same thing but with added speaker issues. Now I have the 3rd replacement and it just died after 3 hours!!!!! AMAZON I EXPECT WAY MORE FROM YOU!<br /><br />In this day and age a 3 hour batter life is not even good enough for our phones, let alone a tablet. I was planning on using this on my upcoming trip with my toddler. The problem is, the Kindle won't even last long enough for the flight, let alone airport waiting time. Besides the battery life, the speakers are TERRIBLE! I almost have to have the volume all the way up just to understand what is being said.<br /><br />Another glitch that I cannot live with is, the notifications while watching a movie. If I am on Netflix and a notification comes in, the volume automatically adjusts WAY down and does NOT go back up. You have to exit out of Netflix completely then go back in for it to be fixed. How many notifications do you get in any give 2 hours? Watch a movie on the new Kindle and you will notice how many.<br /><br />Amazon, it seems like you had a hit with the Kindle Fire and in your haste to make a quick dime, you sacrificed quality to satisfy the masses. It's too bad that is going to drive away any business you could have received from very satisfied customers.

She is 49 years old and this is her first touch screen device ever (she's still using an antiquated flip phone that we'll be upgrading shortly). The audio and video quality is amazing. For folks not used to touch screen devices, there is definitely a learning curve. For those of you who are familiar, you will have no problem with this software. I purchased this with the understanding that this would be able to mirror the tablet to my LCD TV. I should have researched that feature further because the list of compatible devices is remarkably small. Unfortunately nothing i already own is compatible. That was a let down for sure. The other let down after the fact was the limited storage space on the device itself. The default 8 GB would have been fine if the OS didn't occupy about half of it. Especially since there are no slots for expandable storage cards. The unlimited on line cloud storage is fantastic, but we are constantly removing older items and apps in order to make room for new items and apps. At the time I ordered this, the 16 GB model was out of stock and had a min. 30 day time line before I would receive it. So basically I settled for 8 GB and am having to deal with it. All in all it is a great little tablet and my wife is happy. She can play her games, quickly browse on line, and have quick and easy access to her Facebook account.

There are an abundant amount of apps designed for children on the amazon app store. These apps range from educational to simple games to occupy time on long car rides. The Kindle Fire has an advanced parental control center so parents can limit the ways their child is able to interact with their tablet. The parental control center can limit the time the kindle is used, it can block any option for a child to buy things online or through games, and it can block content that is deemed inappropriate by the parents. Anyone who likes reading would also be interested in purchasing the Kindle tablet. It has access to the amazon bookstore so books can be downloaded directly to the tablet. People who are avid shoppers would also be happy to know that the amazon tablet comes with access to the amazon store built in. Frequently there are deals posted on the store only available to Kindle users. I am an avid reader and a student; this tablet was perfect for me because I had an entire library at my fingertips and I could find electronic copies of my textbooks at reduced prices. The kindle also allowed me to download the Adobe app so I could sort and view my reading assignments that were in pdf format.<br /> The most prominent features on the Kindle Fire are the vivid 7??display, the sleek button-less appearance, and the Dolby Dual Stereo speakers. The kindle?? size is perfect for holding with two hands. It isn?? so large that it feels like a laptop and it isn?? so small that it feels like a smartphone. The buttons for the kindle are on the back side and they are slightly indented into the back of the tablet. The button placement lends to your hands being placed in an area that amplifies the sound from the speakers directly to your ears. Even if the tablet is placed on a flat surface, the Dolby Dual Stereo sound is surprisingly loud for such a small device.<br /> The main benefits of the Fire  are the access to amazon cloud, amazon prime, and the relatively low price. The amazon cloud lets the user access their purchased material from any device with an internet connection. Amazon offers a service called amazon prime that offers discounts on all products and access to unlimited television and movie streaming. The Kindle Fire 7??is available brand new on amazon for $139. This is much cheaper than comparable tablets. The only negative side to the Kindle is the eight hour battery life and limited access to android app store. Compared to other e-readers, the kindle?? eight hour battery life is low. This is because the kindle fire has a much more powerful and graphics intensive screen. Other e-readers use screens that use e-ink. This uses next to no power so they can have batteries that last for days of use.<br /> Overall I would recommend the Kindle Fire HD 7??tablet. It can be a great tool for many types of people; students, children and professionals can gain something from what the kindle fire offers. The kindle can be used to play children?? games or a graphics heavy online game, read books for school or pleasure, and has many productivity apps that can help the student or professional.",20/03/2015,1

We tried multiple soft and hard resets and even went so far as to do a factory default reset and wipe the unit but it would not connect back to the wifi. The problem was with the unit, as our other devices were connected and still working just fine. Customer service was prompt and agreed to send a new one and have me send the old unit back. But this is frustrating to have had the unit such a short amount of time before having to send it back. It was in excellent shape with both a screen protector (which is now useless as it can't be reapplied) and a child proof case on it.<br /><br />The tablet seems alright otherwise, when it was working. The Amazon free time allows her to download a lot of child friendly materials including games, books and tv shows. I do hate the ads that appear on the screen when you first turn on the machine. There is the option to pay to not have these appear and I think that is an absurd rip off to have to pay even more money to keep my child from seeing ads for romance novels. I assume it shows the romance novels since the kindle is registered to my account and I have purchased them in the past for myself. But to have a bodice heaving chick appear on the screen of your 7 year olds device is disturbing. I think they should just remove the ads altogether because I guarantee I won't buy a single item that appears on it, if anything just out of spite for being inundated with the ads.",20/03/2015,0

Today, I wish to retract the positive review.  The kindle worked fine right up to the point when it stopped working.  The first one stopped while still in warranty so Amazon sent a replacement. The replacement worked right up until two weeks after the warranty expired then it stopped.  This time catastrophically.  It won't turn on, it won't take a charge and after spending an hour with the technical support folks and having tried every trick in their book, they concluded that it should be replaced.  Then they discovered that it was two weeks past warranty. So tough luck. Amazon offered to sell me a new one.  I consider myself reasonably smart - two advanced degrees - so I was amazed that Amazon would expect me to buy yet another poorly manufactured product from them. I initially thought the Kindle was a good buy but if it has only a one year life, you are better off buying a higher priced, better quality device.  My advice - don't buy a kindle.",19/03/2015,0

There simply is no tablet on the market where you can do dishes, clank around the kitchen, and watch a video without headphones.  However, the 8 gig is a little short on memory.  With just Facebook installed, I have only 2.5 gig left for downloading.  For twenty more dollars, I'd get the 16 gig, especially if this is your  only tablet.  I also am a bit disappointed that the text to read option has gone away.  Listening to articles on the web was something I liked to do while working that I cant do here.  I can on my ipad.  Yes, understandably, I know they  want to sell audio books, but what about the sight impaired and why not have it available for web pages?  That's a personal perk for me but if you don't care about that,  read on.  It's a very user friendly tablet.  Grandma will get it.  The keyboard is easy to use.  It's small enough to hold in one hand, though a tad heavy compared,to an iPad.  Still with my small hands, I find it easier to hold than my iPad mini. A grippy back would be nice.  I'm not a case fan but there's no way you're  going to use this without, so get a light one.  The roocase I review is perfect.  Durability:  seems these guys don't quite measure up to Apple.  Mom had an hdx die just short of a year and she treats it with kid gloves.  Luckily it was just short of the warranty expiration  and got replaced.  Keep in mind Apple is just 30 or 90 days (forget which) and Apple care is insanely high priced.  That said, my ipad mini is in its third year of heavy use and still going strong.  I just can't hear it at a distance and  it's still too big to hold in one hand.  Also mega pricey.  For under 200 dollars this is a nice tablet, especially for prime members.  Amazon's customer service is  impeccable. I have never had the problems others complain about in all the years I've been dealing with them.ally for prime members.

When playing a game, you have to turn off your internet (wifi) access in order to truly play ad free.  I also miss the simplicity of the first version of kindle fire screen.

It's mostly intuitive to use, but could use some upgrades.<br /><br />I bought this for two reasons:<br />  1: I have a young daughter who might like this on long car trips<br />  2: I'm trying to convince my wife to get rid of the $99.97 cable (just cable; not internet) bill that we get every month<br /><br />Results:<br />  1: My daughter loves it; she is currently 6 months old. Yes, she sits in a rear-facing car seat, but we used one of her headbands to secure the Fire to the rear seat headrest that is above her car seat. She doesn't mind that there is a headband through the middle of the screen. She is absolutely enamored with it; we hear nothing but small &#34;coos&#34; from her (unless she's hungry or she has delivered a huge &#34;present&#34; for us&#34;) as she watches &#34;Despicable Me&#34; over and over. I haven't figured out how to play a video on repeat so when it's over my wife leans and reaches over from the passenger seat to re-start the video.<br /><br />  2. We have an older TV: 2007 Plasma (Pioneer if  you're wondering). It still has a great picture, yadda yadda. It does not have a plug-in for USB power so I have to run a charger from the wall to the HDMI adapter to the TV. First world problems, I know. The picture is great and the sound is fine when running from Amazon Prime programs. The problem is that my wife can't do without her f****ing housewife programs which are not offered by Amazon Prime nor any other service that I know of (Hulu, Netflix, etc).<br /><br />Conclusion: This is a great product that is somewhat lacking in the apps department. It has good battery life, good picture, decent durability, and a wide range of uses. It does not get 5 stars because it needs a more robust app store and because the Amazon Library is lacking in some areas.",18/03/2015,1

Always wanted a tablet and for the price I thought that this would be the best choice to get me started. As a college student my main reason for getting it was to take it to class with me for ebooks and note taking, which works great for this. Games are a huge plus as well, they look great, and are responsive. Its fast for browsing the web as long as my internet cooperates. (its sluggish sometimes because there is over 7 devices on it at any given time) The screen is nice and clear, and the tablet is small enough to fit in your hand but still large enough where you can see everything. I love the color, and while many people complain about the plastic back, I kind of like it. Better that they save costs there and use plastic rather than cut performance or image quality and use a metal case. It feels solid enough to me as well, and has some weight behind it, its heavier than my moms 2012 HD 7 and comes with a lot more features.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The only issues that I have with it thus far is the lack of apps in the Amazon App Store. You don't get the same apps as the Google Play Store, or Apples app store. For example the Amazon app store does not have Clash of Clans or Snapchat. They do offer alternatives though such as Snapgrab or Castle Clash. I just wish they offered a little more selection. They do offer a number of books though, so if you are into reading thats a plus. Another downside to this tablet is the camera quality. The rear facing camera has a 2MP camera, which is worse than nearly all smart phones today, and not much better than my basic phone that I had a while ago. Shooting video is okay at best, but taking pictures with the rear facing camera is just god awful. The pictures come out grainy and if the object you are taking a picture of has any sort of movement it comes out very blurry. The front facing camera is alright if you plan on using it a Skype call. Camera quality could deffinitely use an improvement, however the cameras do get better as you move higher up in the price range and begin looking at the HDX. The final issue is storage. I got the 8gb and that only leaves 4gb for the user. Which really limits you on what you can put on it. They do give you unlimited cloud storage, but some apps can take up a large amount of space, including ebooks.<br /><br />Overall:<br />So the bottom line is that this tablet is great. If you can look past the camera then I would look into getting this tablet. Storage is not that great, but surprisingly I havent filled it up yet, and I have a number (about 13 or so) of games and apps installed right now, the largest being 1.26gb. It hasnt been slow or sluggish yet, and the screen is amazing to look at, all the webpages come in clear and crisp. The app store is a bit of a downside but you can enable the option to install third party apps from another market place if you would like.",16/03/2015,1

I had an 2gen Fire but I wanted one that I could load more items on and that had a better reading screen for outside. With my new Fire, I can keep so many items accessible to me on the unlimited cloud and they have improved the screen glare so that I can now read and play games much better outside. The Fire is lighting fast in all actions and especially in downloading items or downloading items back and forth from the cloud when I need them. I also love the camera, which I didn't have in the older version. It takes nice clear pictures and between the cloud and the device, I'm able to store over 600 pictures. I now use my Fire especially on vacations, so I don't have to carry my laptop. I have access to my email, Facebook, Netflix, and any movies and pictures I want to see. I can even open (not edit) some of my personal files thru my Dropbox account.  I play casino games extensively on my Fire and the graphics are so bright and the game moves lightening fast with no lags. Love, Love, this Fire.

Certainly better price than a full tablet. She ended up not liking it so I inherited it. I think Amazon is trying to replicate the walled garden approach used so successfully by Apple. However, with those products one is able to at least be productive. Forget ANY Google apps- there are none in the Amazon app store. There isn't even my top-rated password manager. On the plus side the screen is crisp and the OS solid. If you want to shop Amazon and watch videos and not much else, this is a great tablet to do just those things. If Amazon would allow those major apps, I suspect they would sell a lot more of these without having to discount the price to move them off the shelves.  UPDATE- After having used this almost daily for several months, I have to take off another star. We buy *a lot* of stuff from Amazon and this tablet excels at that and not much else. If something pops into my head and I need to email, text or edit a 'to do' list, I have to set this down and go to a computer or my phone to accomplish it. What an inconvenience in this day and age. It's okay for watching Amazon Prime movies or Netflix (I'm surprised they even support this app!), but several other free movie apps are missing. If I had to do it over again I wouldn't buy this (even though there are some pluses listed above), but would spend the few extra dollars to have a fully operational tablet. They made the same mistake with the Fire phone (from what I read) and sales are dismal. I imagine people aren't waiting in line for these either. Spend the money and get something with the apps that 95% us use.",15/03/2015,0

First impressions were it was a solid tablet and much better than previous ones I tried using. After about 2 months I accidently fell asleep in bed with it and upon waking up it fell about 2ft to a carpeted floor and the touch screen stopped working completely. I contacted Amazon about replacing the screen and since the design they used it is not like other tablets on the market where the screen can be replaced. So I am stuck paying almost market value to have the screen replaced which is kind of pointless. I was really expecting a better design granted it was my mistake that lead to its demise. I just want everyone to be aware of this prior to purchasing.   **********UPDATE 3/17/2015*********  Spoke with Amazon customer service today (associates name was Indira) and she resolved the issue I previously had with my Kindle fire.

I upgraded the router software and it did work. I was frustrated that out of the hundred items that I use Wi-Fi with, the kindles all had issues with my router.<br /><br />Now my biggest complaint is not being able to use google play for my APPS.  I understand competition but Amazon's selection is horrible compared to Google's.  Also the aps that Amazon does have are garbage. Even their own Amazon app is bad.  Half of the time I put down my kindle and grab my smartphone to use the same aps that I have on my kindle(and the thousand other apps that Amazon does not have).<br /><br />It really sucks because my Fire is turning into expensive paper weights.

And while I won't say I regret it completely, the Kindles leave a lot to be desired in both functionality and ease of use relative to an iPad.  One of the two devices crashes routinely or freezes and has to be completely rebooted.  The device menu and help pages tend to be non-intuitive and not pleasant to use.  Supposedly, you can also drag and drop music and movie files on the devices but I can't get them to play with sound on either device in various encoding formats..  I also have experienced significant trouble connecting to certain WiFi networks - especially on airplanes, which is when I really needed them to function properly the most.  Lastly, the online help available is less than helpful - if the topic you're searching for even exists in the first place.  I generally find better help by Googling third party message boards.  Conclusion: If you're on a tight budget like I was when I bought them, or you're seeking devices for younger kids/children, then they're passable.  However, if you have the money or you need to be a serious tablet user, I'd opt for considering the substantially more expensive iPad.",13/03/2015,0

I think that the home screen is an easy access way to get around. There are an abundance of neat features. However I have come up with a list of features which I think would be really cool to have and frankly I think they are a necessity.<br /><br />First off,  wallpapers!  Please make it to where you can at least have a home screen wallpaper!  The gray,  bleak default is quite boring.  So please Amazon make this an option. I believe that this would male your customers very happy.  I personally Would love to have a wallpaper.  And if you can also make it to where the non adult versions of the Kindle to have a lock screen wallpaper.<br /><br />A second thing that I would like to see is more animations. Make the os more appealing to the eye. Create animations for opening folders and opening apps.<br /><br />Amazon stop being apple and allow more customazation.<br /><br />Reach out to more app developers and make the App Store more wide in variety.  If you want,  even consider adding the Google Play store to the device.<br /><br />Here is a suggestion for a new multitasking interface. When you slide up from the bar at the bottom,  instead of just the apps showing,  show pictures of what you were last doing in that app. The name off the app would be on top of the image with the app icon next to it. Have it to where when you tap the app,  it enlarges from that point and fills up your screen.<br /><br />now lastly I would like to see a new notification bar. Let users customize the color of it.  Make it similar to Android lollipop where if you Swype on the left, you get notifications and on the right quick settings.<br /><br />Also in the settings add a search feature and a recently used feature<br /><br />  Thank you for reading,<br /><br />  Kelby's Bricker",10/03/2015,1

I purchased the Fire 7&#34; when my Kindle Touch suddenly bit the dust. First, it's main purpose - that of reading Kindle books and occasionally listening to an audio book - works well and my only complaints are: 1.) it's slow - 3 minutes to load 11 books on my device. 2.) One cannot delete books from the Fire - you have to go online to do so.  That's poor planning. 3.) One cannot successfully do two things at once - such as listening to music while browsing Pinterest.<br /><br />Those are just a few of my disappointments with my fire.  Still, if someone were to give me the choice again today I'd make the same choice.  It's a good price for what the tablet is able to do. The Kindle reader is handy and I like the things now available such as seing the table of contents on the left (if you wish), being able to group books in your library in &#34;collections&#34;, and unlimited storage on the cloud.<br /><br />It's good and I'm looking forward to positive changes in the future.",9/03/2015,1

Means it's great.,"When I call my Kindle Fire a life changing item, I really mean it.  I no longer buy books made of paper.  The void left by the lack of book clutter has not gone empty - oh no.  That void has been filled nicely with stuff.  But I digress.  This version of Kindle Fire places the buttons back in a more intuitive spot.  The power and volume buttons are on the edge instead of the back.  To me, this makes sense but I can't explain why.  The speakers are on the back.  Tiny little things that point away from the user.  It's fine I guess since a lot of people use ear buds.  The screen resolution is beautiful, the interface is simple.  Set up is fast and easy too.  Probably the only thing I don't like is the alarm feature volume is so quiet.  I didn't hear this alarm go off and it was 4 feet away from me.  Don't expect to wake up with this alarm.  I do like the option to add a user.  Now my hubby can borrow my Kindle Fire and not have his settings replace my own.<br /><br />I love my Kindle Fire.  My hubby benefits since he gets my older one.

One small problem is that Flash is not available for the device, which can affect some sites that have animated content.

The interface has had some pretty substantial features added to it (better management of app shortcuts, ability to create groups, support for new features and apps, etc.), but still will still be familiar to someone accustomed to the original one.<br /><br />Inclusion of the rear camera and a few new apps is particularly nice. Especially the new default install of a maps application. Although the unit does not have a GPS and cannot be use for routing, the lack of an out-of-the-box map application on the original Fire was a feature I felt was missing. Although the included app does not compare with Maps from the Google Play store, its nice to have basic location-based stuff (food, stores, addresses, etc.)<br /><br />This unit is much lighter than the original. In a way, this is a double edged sword though. While the reduction in weight is nice, the unit does not feel as solid as the first generation.

I still have two old Fires in storage and I absolutely loved those, I just needed to move on. I don't have any truly serious complaints about the new Kindle HD 7. It's just that it didn't grow on me like other models did. There really isn't anything great about the current model. The screen colors are washed out compared to my other devices and the design is bland. I also had a problem with the page number feature. When tapping the lower left corner to get the page number or progress, it often wouldn't register at all. I had to keep backing out of the book then tap the bottom left corner again, then it would register. Until making a note or highlight, then it wouldn't register again. That was very annoying since I rely on this feature.<br /><br />Other than that, the sound was decent. And I could use it as a Kindle e-Reader and audiobook device. I don't mind the ads and limited app store. I knew what I was getting into. I just didn't love it, it's so lackluster. I went back to the Kindle apps on the iPad mini and Nexus 7.

My original was working but was getting glitchy, so I decided it was time for a new one. The new Fire HDs are nice and work more smoothly, but are still similar enough to the original that you don't have to relearn everything. Granted, I usually use mine only for reading and occasionally browsing the web, but I do like the camera feature as well. One thing I like is that it provides books that are relavent to the one you are reading. It also makes quick work of posting a review of a finished book on Goodreads, and makes Goodreads more accessible. The only down side so far is the battery life drains faster than on the older kindles, but I imagine it's because the Fire HDs are a little more high-tech.<br />PS- i do think it's bogus that you have to pay $15 to avoid ads on the lock screen.

However, there are some features that I miss from my old Kindle 3 keyboard. First while the dictionary is efficient at looking up words that &#34;push&#34; on in the text, you can't look up words in the dictionary itself very well--at least I don't know how to do it. Secondly, when making notes in the text, there are fewer symbols available. For example, I wanted to use an ampersand, but one was not available. If I want to highlight some text, then sometimes if the dictionary comes up and blocks the text I want to highlight. I also think there were some apps available for the older Kindle that were better than what's available for the Fire. For example, I can't find a calendar app that is just for the device and has more than just very basic features. As a reader, I wish that Amazon hadn't done away with the keyboard version.

Don't be quick to believe the full star reviews as they most likely are paid to provide those ratings.  This makes the FOURTH time Amazon has shipped us a replacement Kindle. There is a KNOWN issue with this model when the battery gets below ~30%, it will randomly shutoff without any alert or notification. Amazon refuses to acknowledge this is a major flaw with this product, therefore they keep trying to sweep it under the carpet by keep sending you NEW Kindles. Each one of them has the same issue..and it doesn't happen right away, but over time..it might be more of a hardware issue.  When watching Netflix, it seems to have a larger affect, most likely it overheats and shuts down automatically..but that's not for me to assume. It's absolutely consistent. Another small issue is that the volume will drop down nearly 50% when receiving notifications while watching Netflix..and will stay that way without returning to normal. You have to exit and re-enter Netflix. It's an incredible pain!  So I suggest you do research before buying, it's incredibly frustrating but moreso because Amazon refuses to recall the devices that are clearly unable to support high processing software, like Netflix, with their hardware.",5/03/2015,0

This Fire 7 came as part of a Black Friday / Cyber Monday bundle. The combination of this and the other item was less than normal price of the other item (which I was going to purchase anyway). How could I refuse? It took a while to get used to it, mostly setting different fonts to find the one my eyes liked best and the right word size. With that completed I found myself reaching for this one more, until it became the first grab every time. Among other things, the color screen is a great help for identifying rocks, and plants in gardening books. The screen display gives noticeably sharper images than the paper white. I have not watched movies or played games on this, but it really works well for reading. It is a bit heavier than the paper white, but I got used to that in a short period of time.  It is definitely a keeper.",4/03/2015,1

I also love how easy it is to watch Prime videos via Amazon including the pop ups with character names/actor names along with song names.  Even trivia items pop up!  If I would have known how much I would love watching movies/shows on this device I would have purchased a larger screen size.  What I don't love:  I can't add Instagram or CBS News as apps.  I don't know what other apps I can't add yet - these are the two so far I have found are not in the app store.  I have yet to take a picture with it that I like.  But I didn't buy this for the camera.  Also, it seems to take HOURS to charge.  My phone charges in an hour but this tablet needs about 5-6 hours when I run it down to a low battery.

The size is the most persuasive feature--fits in coat pocket (not in jeans, however), and I was able to shlep it and the keyboard all over Australia without difficulty (the keyboard, which I got separately, is adequate for email, and possibly for more extended work once you get used to the placement of things like semicolons, which are not where your fingers expect them to be; it's a significantly bigger form factor than the Fire itself, but thin and lightweight.  Spending more for the 16 GB made sense for me--I was able to download 4 feature films for those long air flights and still have plenty of room for music, books, etc.  One odd note considering the Fire's heritage--I still prefer my paperwhite for plain old reading.

Most videos won't play because there's no real way to get the plugins to play them without going out of your way to instal an old Fire browser called Dolphin which then gives you the fun of every single website you visit from that point on asking which browser you want to open it in, even though you set your default browser to Dolphin. The app store is pretty limited, most useful apps are not available, but you have your choice of games if that's what you like.<br /><br />Restrictions aside, the device doesn't hold up over time. Recently my device has started to shut itself off every time I connect to wifi unless my device is plugged into a wall, which defeats the &#34;mobile device&#34; purpose. I was lucky to finish a college course because I had rented a digital textbook from Amazon (also not recommended) when my device started acting up and it took me awhile to figure out that I could run it as long as I was plugged in. Being barely at the year mark for owning it didn't help and my only option from Amazon was to purchase a discounted refurbished device, like I'd trust another tablet from them after my current experience. I'm not putting another penny towards an Amazon Tablet.<br /><br />Frankly, I won't be buying another amazon tablet. I love my Paperwhite but have more hate towards Kindle Fire than is probably rational at this point. I've never felt so much dislike or disappointment from a device from Amazon and I will not be trusting another tablet in the future.<br /><br />I now have a very shiny, no surface damage, still charges device that I can't take anywhere or do anything with because the wifi doesn't let me keep the device ON which is kind of the point of using a tablet: wifi and function.",3/03/2015,0

Regrettable purchase. Before I sent it back I kept it for about two, three weeks, to see if there were any redeeming features, and by the time I was done, I wanted to use the Kindle Fire as actual kindling for a campfire.<br /><br />It was well below expectations as a full-fledged &#34;tablet&#34;. For one, no versions of the device allow you to add a wallpaper.  But if you don't pay more, Amazon programs the device to display random ads on your lockscreen and homescreen. But in neither case can users add their own pictures??? K. The whole built-in-ads thing kinda works as a cost cutter for apps and websites, but if users choose between two *physically existent* devices and can't afford the artificially more expensive one, how's it make sense to put in ads to buy more stuff?<br /><br />Also: Setting up the pre-installed mail app is impossible to figure out. Watching video in browser is interrupted by stupid address bar and tabs at the top -- even in fullscreen. It's an android device with zero customizability, and no access to the Google play store. Support for Google Apps is basically nonexistent -- humongous problem since I use them all for school: Google Drive/docs/sheets, gmail, calendar, everything.<br /><br />I was hoping to use it at least as an eBook reader for schoolbooks I bought digitally. Still failed. If you count the fact that there were words on the screen and I can read, I guess its kind of okay. It's cool that this one small device can hold thousands of books, but then again, I never really wanted to carry around thousands of books at once anyway. I would rather endure carrying around the three or four books I'm reading at the time and putting the rest on a shelf that than spend over a hundred dollars for an ability I already have. Without a second thought, I long ago would only have bought paper books if I knew what I was getting into with Amazon. They have ruined my experience with them completely, and I would actively discourage friends and relatives from using their digital products.",2/03/2015,0

The 7 inch display also seems to be the perfect size - not too large and not too small.  If I was forced to make any kind of criticism of this device, I would point out some of the icons and menu option layouts could be organized in a more logical manner.  There is an unnecessary learning curve involved in moving from screen to screen and icon to icon - sometimes a screen will come up and it isn't clear what kind of tapping or swiping is needed to get off that screen.  It would make more sense if the 'back' arrow and 'forward' arrow were ALWAYS visible on EVERY screen.  But this is a relatively minor complaint.

That refurbished Kindle shut off on me during set up while it still had 75% battery life. How unfortunate that I might just resort to not using a Kindle anymore.",2/03/2015,0

I mostly use it for reading and checking social media (twitter and Facebook). As far as speed is concerned I'd say it's fast enough. Definitely not blazing but like I said no real complaints there. When I was looking to buy one I saw other reviews where lots of people doted on the amazing sound of the Kindle fire. Although this wasn't a priority for me I must say that the sound has blown me away as well. It has kicked me out of apps a few times but not so much to make me regret my purchase. I got the Kindle fire because I was using my Samsung Galaxy S4 so much that I'd have to charge it two or 3 times today. My Kindle has remedied that situation as I only charge my phone overnight now and the Kindle gets charged every 2 or 3 days with what I would call moderate use.

But, I was really disappointed when I looked at the app selection! It was very limited. The 2012 Kindle Fire HD had more selection. For a new tablet, I expected better. Upside! I went online and looked at a way to get good apps for my new Kindle. First go to your settings and allow installation of outside apps. Download the ES file from Amazon App Store. Then go on line and download 1 moble market app. ( look on line on how to do this. The man who posted this information explains it way better than me ) because of 1 moble market and that man who posted that information, it saved me from returning my new Kindle back to Amazon!<br />1 moble market has way better apps for the new Kindles than the Amazon App Store.

You can get this Fire in 5 different exterior colors, but you can't change anything on the inside?  Kind of lame Amazon ... just saying ... Otherwise, everything else is as expected.  The display is gorgeous and the apps that you can get on it all work flawlessly.  I guess I missed some of my extra research ... didn't realize they closed all the rooting loopholes (for now) on the latest models.<br /><br />I definitely suggest getting the screen protectors and a nice case.  I picked up a case for less than $12 that fits it well and gives you all the neat features of the expensive amazon cases (lift the cover, wakes it up, stylus pen comes with, leather, color of your choice, etc ...)

Sturdy and feels like it will last and not break in 2 weeks. I can watch Netflix with no glitches or buffering. It goes right to my wifi after initial set up with no problems. It arrived quickly and was packaged well. I had the 1st generation Kindle for several years and even dropped it while sleeping and stepped on it when waking up without breaking it. This seems to have the same quality construction.  My first book order came through quickly. What I needed was quickly being able to order from the Amazon site, get books, watch Netflix and fluff around on Facebook and read email. That's really all I need. The camera turn out to be quite nice. I was pleasantly surprised since I use a dslr for my camera needs. A quick shot from the device isn't bad at all. Video is crisp and clear, sound is wonderful through my ear phones and without. The price for the quality you get is top notch and it works wonderfully every time it's turned on. All in all what the heck else could you ask for? Except............<br /><br />My question now is.........what the heck happened to the battery life? I used to be able to charge my 1st generation kindle once a week. This is more like a phone battery. Yes, it last longer than a phone but I have to charge every single day now.<br /><br />Ads? You really need to give me ads? My opening screen has an ad on it? You give me &#34;suggestions&#34; that I didn't ask for?

Sorry boys and girls but outsourced support is always a bad idea. I can't understand them, they can not understand me and the connection is never good. Considering all other Amazon support is the best I've ever experienced and why I am such a loyal Amazon supporter, this is sad indeed.<br /><br />Please please I can not stress enough, Amazon please do not go the route everyone else goes. You have a great product, you have what we want with better quality than would be expected at the price you give. Some of us are serious readers and would stand on a box and scream your support to all those other tablets out there. Don't turn this into a venture. We are loyal customers here to the very end. Don't go down that road and ad us to death. Don't take away from the greatest product at the greatest price.<br /><br />I'd of given 5 stars even with the battery draining faster than the first Kindle I owned but those ads, man those ads have got to go.

Picture is crisp, sharp, balanced, and pleasing.  Sound is very good for a unit this size.

After being a long-time Kindle, Blackberry phone and Blackberry tablet user (yes, they make/made a tablet), I decided to make the switch to Android.  I did, and haven't looked back.  I assumed (I still think reasonably so) that my Android apps used on my phone would work on my Android Fire tablet.  Well, there's the rub.  Some of them, more than a few, simply can't be found on the Amazon app store.  And the Google Play store says their apps won't work on my device (this isn't true, but that is what it says.)  Bottom line, I can still do some things on my phone I can't do on my Fire tablet, besides making calls.  That isn't cool with me.  There are ways to get around it, but &#34;work arounds&#34; found on the internet which may or may not work with varying effectiveness is a particular joy I thought I'd left behind when I left Blackberry.  Not entirely.<br /><br />Amazon:  I get that you want us to use your app store and yours alone.  You're a jealous lover and we get that.  But that kind of (very) old-school fidelity doesn't work today.  Sure, make your hardware work incredibly well with your content, but don't shut out other Android apps.

It is a really wonderful Kindle with the capability to watch a video, but it is a kindle in my opinion not a tablet. This is not a tablet to be compared with any of the other leading tablets on the market. It's a great electronic device. But it is far more cumbersome to just browse the web (could just be because I am used to the iOS interface...) It is perfect for magazine subscriptions. It is far superior to other tablets in that realm. And I love it as just a kindle as well.<br /><br />My use for this is that I have a large number of work-related PDF's that I need to have handy and searchable at any given time. I travel constantly for work. I was keeping these items on my other tablet. But, it was soaking up space and I didn't have space for all my work docs, pics, music, apps, etc. I had to branch out and find another, more cost effective way to manage my professional documents electronically. This is the PERFECT solution. It is wonderful for my work documents, even better than my other tablet! I keep all my documents on there and it's portable. So portable I can slide it into a pocket and head out anywhere for work with every pub/document/instruction/etc I need. And it's freed up tons of space on my web browsing tablet to have fun on that one. Sometimes I use the kindle for things that are not professionally based and it's not as wonderful, but for its price, it is not bad.<br /><br />READING<br />-Books: backlit, syncs to your kindle, my husband complained once that it synched in the wrong spot, but we've had just that one issue. I prefer to read on just a Kindle, vice the Fire, because the backlight and screen is less harsh on my eyes.<br />-magazines: BEST magazine reading medium, orgnaize your subscriptions, flip through like a magazine<br />-documents: good for pdfs and docs that you may have, searchable and with the ability to take notes/highlight<br /><br />BROWSING:<br />-works well for browsing, although the screen is a bit small to have it as your only item. You could not abandon the computer and just browse on this.<br /><br />APPS:<br />-So far the apps I have looked at have been disappointing. However, I've only looked at a small number of apps.<br /><br />SHOPPING:<br />-Shops on amazon like a dream. I do a ton of amazon shopping and this is really wonderful.<br />-Shops on other websites like most other tablets, doable, but not easy<br />-App based shopping: I have not used any shopping apps to shop on the Fire.<br /><br />BATTERY:<br />-my biggest complaint, my battery does not last nearly as long as other tablets or kindle's.",27/02/2015,0

I had held off buying a tablet because I really like books and the satisfaction of turning a page and physically interacting with the book.  However, my family gave this to me for a Christmas gift and I am really glad they did!    There is so much to like about my Kindle Fire HD, 16 GB.  While I primarily use it for reading, I must admit to being hooked on many games and apps, many of which I got free through the Amazon Store.  I like the easy backup to the cloud as I keep most of my games, apps and books on it and download when I am ready to read it.  Since I read to fall asleep, I had difficulty at first, being stimulated by the light, but now I turn the brightness down to its lowest point and often fall asleep with it.  Luckily it turns off by itself.    I also want to thank you for the design of the USB connector.  I sometimes forget I have it plugged in and accidentally yank on the cord when moving the device and no matter how many times I have done this, the USB port is still securely fastened and not loose.  I can't tell you how many laptops I have had to have serviced or replaced because the power connection loosens over time.    The main reason I am leaving a review is that I want Amazon to improve some things so that when I buy the next generation it fulfills my needs even better.  So while these may be viewed as criticisms, they are really a request for improvements.    Management of Books  I am a prolific reader.  Sometimes I am in the mood for a literary, mystery, romance, or a cookbook, however, Kindle has no way of organizing books by genre, only by title, author or date purchased.  With well over a hundred books in my library, this can take forever to find the book I would like to read at the time of reading.  Also, sometimes, I'd like a novella due to time constraints so I'd like to know how many pages as well.  The only way to do this is to go back to the Store to get this information and I can't scroll the library and the store at the same time.    Secondly, I'd like to delete a book right after I read it without having to go the Manage My Kindle App.  As it is, every week or two I go to the Manage the Kindle App to delete all books I have read and this can take a long time.  Its especially frustrating when the alpha order in Manage My Kindle does not match the Alpha order on my Kindle, so I have resorted to typing each book in manually, making the process even longer.  Sometimes its an issue with the word THE at the beginning of the Title, but sometimes the title doesn't match and I have to go searching by author instead.    Thirdly, the scrolling function is not there for games.  There is one for Apps and Books but not for games. I surprised myself with how many games I have on my Kindle with many downloaded for my nephew when he comes to visit.    I really like the Favorites section in which I can add a book that I want to read and/or purchase in the future.  I would Amazon to expand on this and add Favorite Authors and not just Titles.  So often, I read a Kindle Book that I like and want to read more by the author.  While I could go in and add each of the author's books individually this is time consuming especially if the author is prolific.  Even worse, if the author comes out with a new book, it won't be on my list.    Like others, I don't like the delay between when apps and games are published for Android and for when I want to get them on my Kindle.  There are some great Android apps that I would like to have on my Kindle but can't download to it from a non-Amazon store.  Likewise I have some compatibility issues even after they have been received from the Amazon store.    Overall, I love my Kindle Fire, but with the aforementioned features and a couple other tweaks (not mentioned) I would be even happier.  to be honest, a more robust way of organizing and deleting novels would have me jumping quickly to upgrade to the next version.",26/02/2015,1

I'm reading books, taking photos and videos, playing free-download games, getting and sending email, browsing the web, etc.  It's my first tablet, so I was concerned about not having a keyboard, but the Fire guesses the words I'm typing quickly and fairly accurately. I've even experimented with just speaking my message and it worked better at speech recognition than any other such program or app that I've tried. It might even teach ME to better enunciate my words.  Picture definition is great and I like having my photos and videos automatically added into Amazon Cloud. Only photography problem I've run into is taking pictures outside, where the glare on the screen made it hard to see if my subject was centered properly - even made it hard to see the icons for taking the picture or turning video recording on and off.  Thanks to the family ebook sharing feature, I started out with a great collection of books (already bought by my husband for his Kindle) for me to read. It was simple to set up my reading options and I've learned how to sort the books into collections.  I'm sure there are many features and options that I haven't yet explored.

It pretty much does everything that an iPad will do, at a fraction of the cost.  I purchased two of them (one for my wife and one for myself).  The battery life is very good, wifi connection is very easy, good signal, amazing camera, great various other features.<br /><br />Now, for the bad part.  There is no background option, unlike all other electronic devices.  NO, you cannot have a picture of your dog, wife, or loved one as your background.  Here's why:  each time you return from any period of inactivity, there is a big stupid ad for one of the absurd games that Amazon is constantly peddling.  These games actually start out free, but then cost as much as 99 Cents per level.  I don't play games on my Fire, so this is a big problem for me.  I don't want games -- and I don't want ads for games.<br /><br />Next, you will find that Google Play and the Android market place are unavailable, because Amazon wants you to only buy the items that they are peddling.  Another BIG PROBLEM.  I've researched and found that high-tech users can go through various hoops to 'ROOT AND INSTALL&#34; the other market places and apps.  This is something that should not be required.  Amazon did not tell me that the Fire would be able to only install Amazon products.<br /><br />If I had it to do over again - - AND I DON'T! -- I would just buy Samsung Tablets.<br />I give Amazon an A- for the performance of the Fire, but an F for all the bogus ads",26/02/2015,0

We didn't care what color we purchased for our girls (6 and 4) because we knew we were going to put solid waterproof/drop-proof cases on them (Poetic Fires) so the color didn't matter. The yellow isn't my fave but with the cases on, you have no clue what color it is anyway! We didn't want to buy them the Kids' Version Kindles b/c they're limited to what can be downloaded and such. Instead, we purchased 2 of these and added child profiles to them. This way, I can use the Kindle whenever they aren't using them and download things in the admin profile for myself (that might be inappropriate for them) and password protect the admin profile. They have passwords for their profiles, as well, to lockout intruders from using the Kindle. All-in-all, these are fabulous. You can set turn-off times, reading limits, and so on. There are always unlimited FREE app downloads on Amazon available, much of which are their faves anyway; i.e. Doc McStuffins, ABCMouse, Starfall and so on.

My first Kindle was the first generation e-reader. It was simple to use and I loved being able to carry my library with me.  I finally became brave enough to upgrade to the Kindle Fire, 2nd generation which I absolutely loved!! The only reason I bought a new Kindle Fire was because I accidently left mine on top of the car...AAHH!!! I originally bought the 6&#34; Kindle Fire HD  to replace it and HATED it; there were glitches in the software which meant it took several tries to go from one website to another. Needless to say, that Kindle was returned.  I decided upgrade to the 16GB and 7&#34; display which turned out to be a very wise decision...LOVE this Kindle! I especially like the fact that the new Kindle has descriptions for each book, unlike my first Kindle Fire.  However when the opening screen shows a product for which I would like information, it takes forever to access the next screen...in fact my patience usually wears out before the next screen appears. A little &#34;Shout Out&#34; to the wonderful people of South Georgia...the individual who found my old Kindle Fire went through quite a bit a detective work and returned it to me about two weeks later.  Several months later...is it me or does Silk really mean Suck?? Trying to navigate the Web has been one giant headache. SLOW....I get thrown out of websites or &#34;tab has stopped working&#34;. I refresh and it last for a few seconds. This is first time I have ever changed a review...I don't know what Amazon has done to Kindle, but I am not a happy camper.",24/02/2015,0

After purchasing our first Kindle Fire 3 years ago we became instant fans and eventually added 2 more to the house due to high demand, from the kids (wink wink). I found myself using the Kindle everyday for tasks that I had used my phone for in the past such as for a portable Netflix/YoutTube viewer when doing dishes or house chores and quick general browsing for recipes, etc. We also found that we use the Kindle the most when traveling for entertaining the children in the car or hotel room and as a reference when looking or booking places to eat or visit.<br /><br />Comparatively, the Kindle Fire stacks up very well to the competition. We all know iPads are nice but not everyone wants to spend $300 on a tablet that gets carried around a lot and used often by the kids. Additionally, I really like the 7&#34; screen as it is plenty big for general use without being so bulky that you cant bring it wherever you would need it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Great overall quality and finish to the product<br />-Intuitive interface that is sure to be a breeze to learn<br />-Size<br />-Price<br />-Accessories<br /><br />Cons:<br />-You have to pay to remove advertisements<br />-Variation between generations requires new cases (but not power cords which is very nice)<br /><br />In conclusion, if you are looking for a great tablet for the entire family, look no further.

I do want to say that we've only had this a few weeks so my opinion could change over time but I think barring a.anything major my star rating wood remain the same. I originally purchased my 3 yr old the 6&#34; 8gb kids fire and it was truly awful (no memory, slow processing) but returned for the adult version in a larger screen size and with more memory for apps, movies and pics. The extra inch of viewing space makes it more useable and he hasn't used up all the memory in a wk like he did with the other version. He finds this mostly easier to navigate than my iPad but it took him about a week to get used to it and sometimes still steals my iPad from me. I find this to be useful for using the internet and watching movies, probably playing games if I did that (when my son takes my iPad) but the small screen still frustrates me even at 7&#34; when trying to do any serious shopping since you can barely view one item on the pg tho the small size makes it easy to carry about with you during the day. This version moves fast enough for basic purposes, screen resolution is decent and so is the camera. I will say that it doesn't hold a charge very well, it seriously sucks up energy (it's gone from 84% charge during the time that I've written this to 60%). 3 hours tops if watching movies straight thru so I don't know if mine is just lemon but I'm not going to hold it against them too much since I can ways get one of those lil portable chargers and I don't imagine it's made to hold a longer charge. I love Amazon, they as a general rule make my life easier and I'm inclined to purchase their products over others because of that but I don't love these fires (i do like them tho). I had two of the earlier fire versions along with the original Kindle reader ones and liked them quite a bit but that was before I had an iPad. I think for the price you get a solid, useable tablet and it'll work best for people who aren't sophisticated with tech, children for whom one doesn't want to shell out hundreds more or as a cheapie tablet for traveling or running about. I can't imagine getting any serious work done on this thing due to the size even tho 16 gb is decent enough memory, it's lack of charge time and it's generally a lil slower than nicer tablets. I love that it's so easy to purchase anything, the separation of family members ( or that my husband and my credit card info can be stored jointly) and that the parental controls are so customizable and that I can prevent my child from not only doing certain activities but also control exactly when and how his time is used. I haven't been an Amazon Prime member since they last raised the price but I would assume that works great in addition to this tablet. Let's face it, a Kindle Fire is essentially a giant Amazon store which is great for anyone who uses Amazon a lot, it makes everything easy. I've been using Amazon since the early 2000's as a college student, thru my early career and now as a sahm in my mid-30's so I've built up a huge collection of books, music, games and movies in cloud that now my son can access as they become appropriate to his age (I doubt he's gonna be reading Proust any time soon but he enjoys my puzzles) but this essentially gives him a decent sized library to choose from as he grows and I've been able to add age appropriate materials to the selection for now. This along with the ease of use and purchasing power makes me inclined to continue with Fires for him as he gets older and I think for most kids these tablets would be acceptable up until college provided they had a secondary device for homework. Let's face it, for the price tag you can't really beat this model but as someone whose used fancier tablets it doesn't quite compare. Now I haven't tried the next step up on the fires given that for the price one can get an iPad mini and I do think for most people if Amazon wants to capture the market they need to consider why anyone would buy a fire for $300 or more when they can get something faster, sleeker and more useful for a similar pricetag elsewhere but if the tech improves and the price adjusts then the next step up of fires might be a better choice for school age children but this one will do for now. I'm so relieved that this product turned out so well after the last disappointment with the kids fire and some other minor Amazon frustrations, I don't know what I would do without Amazon in my families life lol. Fyi, the advertisements are barely noticeable so I couldn't imagine paying for one without, they just run on the screen when it's locked, not during active use. Oh but I find the keyboard kind of awkward, the way it's laid out and moves doesn't work well for my small hands but that could just be me. In any case my son loves his &#34;pad&#34; and it's a great educational tool as well as babysitting device when mommy's running errands or on the phone, just make sure you have enough things physically downloaded for use out and about or you could have a frustrated kiddo on your hands.",23/02/2015,1

In the summer of 2014 I started having trouble with it booting up and keeping its battery life. Because it was &#34;out of the warranty&#34; time frame (1 year) I had to put up with it hoping it would get better. I took the few apps I had on it (Facebook, Twitter, and Flipboard) off the Kindle. I also disconnected my email and reset it. I hardly ever turned on the wi-fi because of loss of battery. My Kindle Fire would not get past the start up kindlefire logo screen.<br /><br />REVIEW: Amazon Kindle has the WORST customer service. I have had grace, patience and mercy for over one year as I have time and time again called customer service to work out the issue with my ????indleFire??HD 7. Their solution is to buy another one (50% off). I could understand that if the problem was because of my error (like dropping it, water, etc). But it is a manufacturers error.<br /><br />Any time I called their customer service they treated me like I was stupid and repeated the same steps each time - even though they can track my customer service calls. I would patiently explain that they had done what they were asking me to do each time I called and it did not fix/change the situation. They scheduled for their supervisor to call me - and they never did. They did reach out by email THREE weeks later to see if the situation changed. The customer service reps (in a foreign country) were following a prescribed list of questions and did not actually listen to the customer.<br />I highly doubt that I will EVER buy one of their products again. If they had good customer service I would stick with them. But with a bad product and bad customer service - they have lost me.<br /><br />My personal review - Go with Apple and then get the kindle app if you want to purchase kindle ebooks. Apple Store has THE BEST customer service and I have learned from this long and painful experience that their price is worth it - even for their customer service alone.er service alone.",22/02/2015,0

I have two iPads, and use them less that any droid-device I now own... Stop trying to be so dedicated to IOS because... it's an Apple and you paid 4 times the price. Get over the buyers remorse and writing reviews to justify it in your mind... lol",20/02/2015,1

I do like the reading interface, not as annoyingly digitized and fluorescent as most pads, laptops, phones. I am not finding the Kindle as user friendly as I would have liked. I feel the OS probably has a lot more to offer but is laid out in a proprietary manner to push sales. The user info was extremely basic, how  to set up log on accounts for multi family members etc.- but no real info or overview on utilizing the device itself. Great - I can connect and receive dead end GUIs for Amazon products I don't want or other applets  I can PURCHASE; its loaded with more commercials and sales pitch than a Super Bowl Sunday! I bought it for a user friendly interface for tween, teen, myself- instead of using our phones- a bit more screen, reading, interface options. So far that hasn't happened. I will pursue some online avenues on my laptop to see if we can make this a bit more user friendly for all, but that's already wading into the &#34;don't bother&#34; area for most people. I did purchase the extended warranty since it was bought with tween/teens in mind, I received an email weeks before the item was delivered that I now have a &#34;warranty&#34; from the third party company.

I bought the 7 HD for my grandson so he could effortlessly read books. I handed it to him, not realizing that parental control had to be installed at the outset and if he set it up, I would have to erase the entire system to re-do it.  Then he began playing games. The device was on my account (do they tell you to set up a separate account?  no) he charged $900 on game enhancements, an Amazon gimmick.  It took more or less an hour to wrestle Amazon to rescind the charges, and I was warned never again would they credit me back. I did not want another game device to monitor.  I did not want him on MY account.  I did not want his device reviewing MY books ordered.  I did not want to have to actively monitor his use.  Today, with an hour or more invested talking to Ms Bangladesh, I was able to get most of this reset, maybe??  If you want your kid to read, DO NOT BUY THIS.  Buy a simple paperwhite or something like it.  This is just a badly designed, clumsy, distracting, money sucking game device.  I think I MAY have gotten this da@#$ed thing under control, but WHY make it so hard?  And do not count on Amazon to give you decent parental control options up front (or even later without lots of questions and patience).  Most kids have too much gaming access.

My dislike comes for the lack of respect and customer service when the tablet beaks down. At the time that I purchased this for my elderly mother, this tablet was the best one out. In less than a year it no longer works, May 2014 and it is now January 2015. I called to see what could be done, my mom likes it and wanted her fixed, Amazon responded by saying they were out of my tablet but would send a NEW replacement. Once I received the package, it was a Refurbished tablet; not what I was promised. I asked my mother, she wanted to know why they can?? just fix hers; Amazon refused. I took it back to Best Buy, with my receipt they refused to give me back my money, stating that this company only guarantees their product in store for 30 days. Again, I called Amazon; I can only get satisfaction if I take someone else's previously damaged tablet. What made matters worse is that the phone representative tried to convince me that it was not refurbished by saying, they ran out of boxes and had to put the refurbish taping on the new tablets. I own an Apple Ipad and Samsung tablet; I wasted my money, trying to make my mother happy. Amazon has no respect for your dollar-buy an Ipad mini instead and let them download the app. You will be satisfied with the customer service and the product. Most apps that they have you can find on Apple, I bought both of my children Ipad minis. Don?? waste your money, if they don't stand behind their products it not worth your risk.

They did not want it so I decided to keep it for myself. This is my honest take on the device.<br /><br />Overall the tablet does an ok job for reading books, playing games, and watching movies. The biggest problem is that the battery is rather faulty. The tablet can be charged at 100% with the screen brightness turned all the way down; no music or video playing and yet within an hour the battery level is at 89%. All I've done within that hour was read articles on the internet and checked my mail, that's it. Watch a video or play a game, obviously the battery will suffer a lot more. I fount myself charging this thing twice a day. Maybe its just my tablet but overall the battery is bad. I will request another tablet to see if it really is just my device.<br /><br />Second, the build quality is decent. The back of the tablet however feels really cheap. So cheap that if you were to put a little pressure on it by just holding it up it would give off a plastic squeaky sound. The tablet is also slightly heavy compared to other 7\\"" tablets on the market. Nothing that will make your arm tired but you'll definitely notice a difference if you've played with other small tablets before.<br /><br />Lastly, the OS at times is frustrating to use and the Amazon App store is lacking a lot of quality apps. I say the OS is frustrating because even though it does a good job of making things simple, there is no way for you to customize the interface to your liking. The tablet is too simple for its own good! You can't even change the wallpaper. It's also frustrating when an app has a Youtube video ready for you to view and it fails to load every time (also the Youtube app just directs you to the mobile youtube website. You wont get the same youtube app experience as the one on Android phones or tablets).<br /><br />A couple of positives though. The Sound coming from this tablet is fantastic. Really good quality. Second, if you are a Prime member you will most likely enjoy the tablet a lot more with \\""free\\"" movies, books, and music. Without Prime I'd honestly say that this would be a paperweight, meaning nothing special. Prime helps this tablet out a lot!<br /><br />With all of this said the tablet in my opinion hasn't been worth the price I paid for over a month ago. Although I never intended to use it to begin with,I wanted to see what all the hype was about and I just don't feel the tablet does a good job at competing with other tablets out there. The battery is really a killer and for a tablet I shouldn't have to charge it twice a day nowadays.ber you will most likely enjoy the tablet a lot more with \\""free\\"" movies, books, and music.

The protector cuts down on the glare.  It does a great job as a Kindle reader for books and it is wonderful to read a book, see another book mentioned, look it up on Amazon and then download it.  Books, apps and website bookmarks pop up very quickly.  The interface for apps and web bookmarks is very good, making it easy to switch between apps or from an app to a bookmark and back.  The Silk web browser works very well.  My only complaint, and others have complained about it as well, is that many apps are not available that are on either an Apple or Android device.  Maybe Amazon sells Kindles at a loss and can't devote money to developing apps, or does not want people to spend time using apps so they will spend more time shopping for books, apparel, etc.  Apple refuses to enter any arrangement with Adobe for Flash Player, which allows the user to see videos and hear audio streams, but this device also does not have Flash Player capability and there are other (e.g., Warp Radio) audio streaming sites it is not compatible with.  If Amazon focused on its app store, they could charge more for the tablets and bring in more Amazon shoppers.  Feb. 14, 2015",14/02/2015,1

I use each for different purposes.  My Paperwhite has the built in wifi, and I take it with me everywhere.  I keep my current reading on it and it's great in doctors offices and anywhere else I have a desire to read.  My iPad is great too, but I do fear that one day it will die, and I use it primarily for emails, web browsing, and a couple of games.  My Fire HD7 is the first step for my buying a flat screen tv, and fire stick as I live in a situation where I can only stream shows from Netflix and Hulu.  My reasoning at the time was that the fire was going to be the easiest way to stream on to a tv using the fire stick.  I am probably a couple months away from that, but in the meantime, I have absolutely fallen in love with the fire.  The screen is so clear and the built in speakers are awesome.  I now consider this one of my favorite possessions, I take the Paperwhite where I can read for longer periods of time as the battery life is longer than the Fire.  If I knew how much I would fall in love with the fire, I might not have purchased the PaperWhite at all.  I am an Amazon Prime member as well as a kindle unlimited member, so I have decided that my unlimited books - those I only keep long enough to read - are only read on my Fire while my purchased books are on my PaperWhite.  Since I am on a relatively limited income, the payment plan for the Fire has made it extremely affordable.  Prior to my PaperWhite, I had owned several different kindles - the kindle keyboard and the basic kindle.  With the severe arthritis in my hands, I cannot hold large books any more and the kindle allows me to easily hold a book and read it.  My iPad is too heavy for me to easily read with while holding it in one hand.  This year I am facing numerous surgeries and reading is my sanity while I'm in recovery mode.  I cannot say enough good things about the Kindle line of products and I do not regret any of my purchases.",14/02/2015,1

I wish I had some help picking out a case before I had to pay shipping & handling on the last case. If I had had this case with my order for my Kindle then I wouldnt have had to pay shipping & handling, but at least  I didnt have to pay to return them so I'm fine with that!<br />Thanks,<br />Linda H.

Then, downgraded my rating to 2 stars, because *when* the device works, I enjoyed it, despite some of its huge flaws. That was before it stopped working altogether. For over two days I was unable to get this thing out of the &#34;boot loop&#34;. After spending two hours talking to FIVE different Amazon customer service representatives, they told me they wouldn't ship me a replacement at my current destination, which is in Peru. So I'd stuck with an expensive paper weight. I was bitterly disappointed to have wasted my money on this, because like I said in my original review below, I mostly bought it due to the price. I should have known to save a little more for an ACTUAL tablet, and not just a &#34;reading tablet&#34;.  Never going to make this mistake with Amazon again.<br /><br />I checked and researched before going to customer service this time just in case there's some trouble-shooting tip I would feel like an idiot for not having tried, and to no surprise, it's quite easy to find a lot of people who are just as disappointed in the same problem with this device. But according to the last individual I talked to at Amazon, supposedly it's a fluke that mine is behaving this way and there's a low probability that my replacement will have the same problems.<br /><br />Then, it finally randomly powered itself back on while talking to him, so I went ahead and did a factory reset while I finally had it working just in case it powered off again before I could. Couldn't hurt, right? I thought maybe something is all screwy in my settings or I downloaded a bad app that deleting it might fix. Once I got my tablet to reboot and re-installed all my apps, the INSTANT I went ahead and touched one (it was Netflix, incidentally), it froze, shut itself off and went through the exact same routine all over again.<br /><br />Since they can't/won't replace it for me (they would if I were in the USA), I'm basically out of luck. I've been SO HAPPY with all the other Amazon devices I'd bought in the past (they should basically pay me a commission for alI the persuasive advertising I've done for them!) I never even imagined it was possible to have a problem, but sure enough, mine won't work properly. I give up on it, and the next time I buy a tablet it will be real one.<br /><br />Original product review below:<br />----------------------------------<br /><br />First, it needs to be noted I've been a huge Amazon fan for about four years, and had never been disappointed previously with any of their products I've purchased over the years. I have gone through three Kindles (I'm currently on a Kindle Paperwhite), and I read voraciously, and about a year ago bought my wife a Samsung Galaxy tablet for more than double what the Kindle Fire HD7 cost.<br /><br />I finally decided **based on the price alone** to take the jump and get a Kindle Fire. I had accumulated enough money on my gift card balance from sharing affiliate links on Facebook to buy one, and this last Black Friday I ordered one without any real loss to my bank account.<br /><br />First, the good:<br />-As far as price goes, you are hard pressed to find a tablet of this quality, this inexpensive. So I am taking that into consideration when giving this device the rating I'm giving it. However, see below.<br />-I have been using it for all sorts of things, specifically surfing the web, using a few apps that are just easier to use on a tablet than a phone, and really enjoy using this device. I am now a huge Evernote fan thanks to having my own tablet and find it much easier to write on my laptop and sync my notes to the Fire tablet.<br />-Great customer service when I had a problem with the device turning itself off and not coming back on, and getting stuck in a perpetual &#34;boot loop&#34; while charging. But that says more about Amazon than the device, per se.<br /><br />Overall it needs tobe admitted that all these &#34;good&#34; qualities are not exclusive to the Kindle Fire tablet, but can be obtained on any tablet, per se.<br /><br />The bad:<br />-When it came, I showed it to my wife, who has been using an Samsung Galaxy tablet for the past year, and she said to me &#34;it looks old&#34;. This thing is *thick* and clunky looking, or at least that's the expectation I've gotten used to after having a slick Android tablet.<br />-The brightness. Seriously? I can't even LOOK at the screen if I'm trying to read in the dark! Even on the *lowest* screen setting. I had to download a blue light filter app, and it works like a charm, BUT if you open the Silk browser (another point of frustration) the filter turns off and you're stuck with an incredibly bright screen again. I don't know whether the app is to blame (which I shouldn't need in the first place if this had a reasonable level of low-brightness) or the tablet's manufacturer design.<br />-The Silk browser is just garbage. Absolute garbage. Nevermind that Amazon makes it incredibly difficult to load other browser apps and you need to side load anything from Google Play, which also seems to cause problems with the tablet's functionality if you do. OK, so I get that Amazon and Google are competition and don't play nice. However, whenever I click on a link from inside any of the apps, whether it be email (native), or third-party social media app, Silk opens, and then... nothing happens. I wait like twenty seconds or however long one needs in order to realize the link ain't opening. One out of three times a tab will open and provide the link I had clicked on, but the other two times nothing.<br />-While writing this review, my tablet has turned itself off twice while trying to download a podcast mp3 I was hoping to listen to (which needed to be done using Silk, incidentally). Since I have never yet successfully download a large file from the internet onto the tablet directly, I always have to do it on my laptop, and then plug in my device via USB to move the files over. I don't understand why I have to even do this, instead of skipping this unnecessary step and downloading it directly using the tablet? This problem has sort of solved itself when I downloaded Podcast Addict and can sometimes successfully download mp3s using that app.<br />-It frequently turns itself off and won't come back on. Thankfully customer service was really helpful when it wouldn't turn back on for a prolonged amount of time (like a day or two), as I mentioned in the &#34;good&#34; section above.<br />-Scratch what I just a bullet point ago. I stopped trying to download the mp3, and went straight to Spotify and after two songs, the device shut off again and won't turn on unless I plug it in. Sometimes a window pops up asking if I am sure I want to power it down, and I hit cancel. Other times it just goes ahead and turns itself off. Is there a reason for this?<br />-When listening to music, whether the native music player app, Spotify, Podcast Addict, or any streaming service, it just randomly shuts off the app for no apparent reason. Strange Brew? If I wanted to randomly turn my music off, I would do it myself since, um, I'm listening to it because I want to.<br />-Sometimes it takes forever to charge the tablet, other times it randomly charges super fast. Is there a reason it can't just charge in few hours on a consistent basis or must I really wait like 10 hours some days before I can unplug and um, USE it?<br />-And the REAL bugger: you don't actually get 8GB of hard drive space like they advertise! I have more space on my outdated Samsung phone than I do on this tablet, which truly only comes with LESS than 4GB of HD space. Why Amazon? This part is probably the most inexcusable because it's not even a design flaw, but misleading advertising. Although I didn't intend on loading it up with videos or photos or a lot of music files, I couldn't anyway if I wanted to! In fact, I don't have anover abundance of apps loaded on this thing, but I'm constantly getting a notification that I need to free up space or that I'm 90% full. What a major disappointment.<br /><br />So yeah, beware: you get your money's worth if you buy one of these things. Put aside a few more coins in the bank and get yourself a real tablet if you need one.<br /><br />Maybe I shouldn't write a review for a product WHILE I'm trying to use it unsuccessfully and with frustration, but that's precisely why I'm going ahead and posting this. While I can't rate this one star since it has many features I like (when the device is actually working properly) I likewise cannot in good conscience or as a satisfied customer give this thing a 5 star rating either as this is much more mediocre of a product than I was expecting from Amazon. They had made a good impression on me with with their dedicated reading devices (I really LOVE my Paperwhite), but this is truly disappointing.<br /><br />All in all, I'm surprised to find an Amazon product is this mediocre. I'd come to expect good quality from them.<br /><br />Edit: I decided to change my review to 2 stars after posting it yesterday. Three was too generous. I have spent MORE time trying to get this tablet to work correctly than I have simply USING it. I was browsing Silk, and three times in 10 minutes it randomly turned off, and then finally wouldn't turn back on. This is the SECOND time in less than a month this has happened.<br /><br />I realize these are cheap tablets, but it would be nice to be able to actually get at least what I &#34;paid&#34; for....s unnecessary step and downloading it directly using the tablet?

The only thing on the screen was the words \\""Kindle Fire\\"". Couldn't be fixed, so dead again.

I wouldn't have a problem with that tactic if they would be more transparent about it and if I didn't have to search through my acct menu just to find a way to pay and disable. Be more up front about that and don't make finding the solution a pain in the butt or some fine print burried with other text. If you go from using an iPad to this, then you might find it frustrating- I don't think it's nearly as user friendly. Wish the kindle had more customization and another way to get to profile switch and home screen. Seems like a home button added to the device would make it a lot easier to use instead of sliding across screen...especially when reading a book. I have to remember that I can only slide in from one side and then have to back out through the book menu just to exit to home. I'm still figuring the kindle out so maybe it will get easier.

So, think about why you are purchasing the Kindle and take a look at the books you are wanting to purchase and if they are compatible with this device.

My customer review has to do with Kindle Free Time for kids and some advice to other parents...the kid's version is described as great for kids 8 and under, while the teen version is described as great for kids 9 and up.  I initially set it to the kid's version because of the age recommendation, but quickly realized 8 years old is plenty old enough for the teen version as it looks exactly like the adult version but with the same parental controls.  Bottom line, an 8-year-old is going to think the kid's version of Free Time is for &#34;little kids&#34; and I know mine will love being in the teen version.  I recommend Amazon change the age recommendations to literacy-based: if your kid can't read yet, use Free Time, if he can read (K or 1st grade and up) then use the teen setting. Either way, both options are fabulous!",10/02/2015,1

I even offered to pay for the battery if Amazon would pay for the labor to replace the battery.  Amazon said the battery could not be replaced and that I would have to purchase a new Kindle if I wanted an operating device.  WHAT A SCAM!!!!!  Instead of giving the client a low-cost option of battery replacement conniving Amazon forces the customer to purchase a new product.  I have both Apple and Samsung tablets that have lasted much longer than a year and would highly suggest those products over the Amazon Kindle.

Then about two months ago it stopped holding a charge, which apparently is a big problem with the first model. So I called customer service to see if I could get a replacement. Since they don't make that model anymore they offered me a discount on some of the newer models. I chose this one and its no where near as nice as the first gen. I do not like the plastic backing and the beveled sides. The speakers are all on one side and makes it seem like the sound is unbalanced. It is lighter but I don't like that it feels like it will break the second it touches the ground. The actual tablet and reader function is fine but there isn't any amazing upgrades to these functions that I can rave about. My advice is to wait until a better model comes out.

I added a Bear Motion genuine leather case and the Armor Suit Military Shield screen protector immediately to give the Fire as much protection as possible.

Customers need to make sure they specify the HD-7 October, 2014 release when they order the Bear Motion case.  This wasn't clear when I ordered the first one and it had to be returned because the &#34;cut-outs&#34; for speakers, camera, etc didn't match up with the Fire.

I think that is a great way to customize and personalize the Kindle for the user's specific tastes.  It's a very durable little tablet. The back of the Kindle is a harder plastic, which acts as a case in my opinion. I have yet to scratch the screen and think that it too is pretty durable. The Kindle Fire HD 7 is definitely a budget tablet. Don't expect to be getting iPad quality here guys. It's not the same OS and it will not perform the same way, trust me. I have an iPad as well. There aren't nearly as many well-tested apps for the Kindle Fire, so there are many issues with bugs and apps. If you aren't careful with browsing the web, your cache is going to build up and really slow this thing down.

In this context, the HD7 does an excellent job in terms of speed and easy navigation.<br /><br />The screen is large enough to allow for typing on the touch keyboard without any problems and the keys on the keyboard are large enough to prevent hitting the wrong key when typing. You can shift from vertical to horizontal display as well which offers some freedom to change perspective for viewing as needed. The resolution is also high quality (I watched a few actions movies and was pleased with the quality).<br /><br />Programs for viewing and editing microsoft word and excel docs are available for purchase in the apps marketplace - $10 is a little steep for a mobile app but it helps with school and could be easily applied to a work scenario where viewing word docs or spreadsheets is required. There are also apps for quickly checking emails and youtube or podcasts. Ebooks for school are also available which can cut the cost of books in half if you like that sort of thing.<br /><br />Internet access is good on campus and I haven't had any connectivity issues yet. The streaming speed is great. So far all the sites I use for school can be viewed on the tablet without any issues.<br /><br />Overall, the HD7 does an excellent job at providing quick access to content required for my education: word processing, spreadsheets, videos, websites, etc are all available. The device is also much easier to carry around than a laptop. Other than these features, the HD7 can also run popular games without much lag so if you need a distraction every once in a while this will do a fine job there as well.",8/02/2015,1

I bought this because it seemed to be spec'd quite well for the price. The display is wonderful. The interface is OK, but not quite Apple-caliber. It locks up and crashes much more than an Apple though. Not enough that I want to give up on it, just don't buy this thinking it is going to do everything fluidly. For example, I tried to go to YouTube on the built-in web browser, and that was a flippin' disaster. It either crashed or locked up 100% of the time. I looked and saw they have a YouTube app; so I installed that, and it works great. Would I buy it again? I think so. Samsung and Apple devices are much higher in price, so high that I couldn't justify buying one and letting kids use it. Probably not myself either, as a laptop is still loads more capable and an iPhone is still loads more portable. But this is 1/3 the price of an equivalent iPad, which even though it is not as GOOD as an iPad, it is still a good buy. It is like comparing a well-equipped Camry Hybrid at $35k (iPad) to an entry level Kia Rios at $12k. They both get the job done, and the Camry (iPad) is certainly nicer, but nice enough that it is worth triple the price? I guess that depends on your budget. For me? This will do nicely.<br /><br />In addition to my 2 year old daughter playing Starfall, my 11 year old son plays Minecraft on it. This constitutes about 95% of the use it gets. It is great for reading in bed. No lights to keep on that will disturb my wife's sleep. I choose the white text on black background, as this draws the least power and also bombards the eyes with the least light. It was almost as pleasant as reading an e-ink Kindle in daylight.<br /><br />This device is also great for checking email.<br /><br />The most limiting factor at this time is the amount of apps available to its Kindle-proprietary operating system. For example, I would have loved to install WeChat and QQ Chat for my wife to chat with her Chinese friends. Those apps are easily available on Droid or iOS. I like the TapaTalk app for browsing internet fora, but it isn't yet available here. I'm sure Amazon will get them eventually. I think the result will be that it is not quite as &#34;open source&#34; as Droid, so it'll have fewer virus and malware issues, but also not iOS, so they can keep the price down.<br /><br />The colored plastic case provides a little bit of scratch and impact protection, and is more easy to hold than Apple's smooth and rounded aluminum.

She absolutely loves it and has it with her pretty much 24/7. After playing with it for a bit, I'd kind of like to swap the iPad for one myself. The Fire is a better size and weight for holding -- you can comfortably hold and operate it with one hand. If you've ever tried reading for any prolonged period of time on an iPad, you know that it's not ideal for that. The Fire has great speakers. The iPad we always plug into external speakers or headphones if we're trying to watch something. The Fire has better settings for reading so you don't get the eye fatigue you do on the iPad (yes, you can invert the display on an iPad to give you light text on a dark background but it also inverts pictures). The pros to the iPad are the ability to have multiple apps open at once and hop between them, and, if you're an Apple user generally, the tight integration with other Apple devices (like Airplay to stream to an Apple TV). But bang for the buck there's no beating the Fire, especially if you're a Prime subscriber which gets you access to tons of movies, original shows, music and more.

What I loved the most about the previous gen was the stability and performance, I mostly use it for gaming, reading, surfing the web and that sort of things.<br />Well stability is no longer a feature on Kindle. So far, in the 3 weeks I've been using it, I've had to restart it by 5  pressing the on button for about 40 seconds, like 5 times, something I never had to do with the old one. Design has improved, Is more attractive, and performance kind of improve too.  But I hate the fact that it lost its stability. I use it, then lock the screen, and then when I wake it up, it doesn't response (as I said, 5 times that happened)<br />The other thing I hate is the new charging cable. Its half the previous one, this is a major downgrade, and I trully hope they correct it in later iterations of this gen, or in the future ones.<br />I still love the Kindle, I'm used to it, and that's why I expect much more.<br />I'm giving it 3 stars until my problem is solved.",5/02/2015,0

I recently purchased a kindle fire 7&#34; HD 16GB (4th gen) I plugged it up to my pc to put stuff on it and BAM bad drivers... so I spent like 3 hours researching how to get this working as conventional methods would yield no results (update driver in the normal fashion or get drivers directly off manufacturers site) and figured out how to unlock the developers mode (this part took like 10 minutes to figure) finally I went and used SDK manager to put the driver I got from a place that is arguably trustworthy (android forums) in and updated it and it worked. I had to use developers tools to use a &#34;user friendly &#34; device in such a way that it was intended to be used. If I wasn't semi android savvy I would have sent the darn thing back and got a 3rd gen. This apparently is a semi common issue that isn't well addressed at this point in time by amazon. I am just appalled that you would release a kindle fire that is one of their big selling E-readers and have such an issue and not put a patch on the device to make it more plugNplay friendly. I however like it now that i have fixed this issue and its not a bad budget tablet once you get past the &#34;can not Xfer data through a usb cable&#34; problem.

I purchased it to replace my Fire HDX - which I gave to my mother because she has a lot more free time and loves playing games and watching Prime video in bed on her tablet (she also loves using the X-Ray capabilities while she's watching shows on the big screen with her Fire TV).<br /><br />Back to the HD 7 - it does everything I could want, and at a great price. I use my Fire HD 7 mostly for video - Prime movies and TV, Amazon original content, HBO Go and Xfinity Apps. My internet connection is strong and fast, and I often listen on my Bluetooth stereo headset (the same one I use with my phone). It's perfect for trips (downloaded content), private viewing when others are sleeping or reading or using the TV for games. It's great for watching something on break or in a waiting room or waiting in a car (wifi or download). It's fast, sharp and the speakers provide good sound.<br /><br />It's far more capable than I expected! As for the other functions - reading is great, and the games are everything you would expect from a more expensive tablet. Facebook and Goodreads integrate perfectly, along with other social media. For entertainment - this is perfect, and it &#34;does the web&#34; just fine too! If you don't need &#34;the biggest, fastest so & so device&#34; - this will be perfect for you too!",4/02/2015,1

Purchased 2 for my kids Xmas presents. Was excited about the parental controls. They both previously had iPads and I wanted a device with parental controls to lock out at specific times and well content/Internet monitoring. The iPads have no such controls. With the kindle fire you can schedule access times and block all/most Internet usage, but must subscribe to freetime to truly be able to filter video content and enable filtered Internet access. Maybe I'm cheap, but the monthly freetime fee is a bit high for me so my kids pretty much only have access to apps, no videos, music, books....<br />Also, compared to an iPad the menus on this thing are herindous. The simplest setting change requires clicking through multiple menus which don't always seem to make sense. Also, why can't we set custom lock screen and background images??????",4/02/2015,0

They need to suggest that you also order the screen proctor or offer it at an extra cost . It would be well worth paying more for it.

My new Kindle simply stopped working after just 5 months; after sitting for a day and a half it refused to turn on, even plugged in.  It wasn't dropped, handled roughly, or anything. Amazon replaced it with a refurbished one, but that one had a malfunctioning screen right out of the box.  I'm going to be asking for another (new) replacement, but my faith in the quality is in doubt.  There are only two function (rather than quality) annoyances I've noticed - the ads on the lock screen are a little annoying (I got it as a gift so I shouldn't complain, but if it were me I'd have paid a little more for no ads), and the device occasionally freezes with certain apps (&#34;Bonza&#34; word puzzle).    However, other than those two small annoyances, I love the Kindle (when it's actually working).  It's a far better size for web surfing than my iPhone, and I can actually print to my wireless printer from the Kindle (revolutionary I know...).  I had initially snubbed e-readers in favor of paper books, but after giving it a try, I'm definitely a convert.  Anyone who says paper books are better should have to lug two 800 page novels around through airport security and spend two seven hour flights holding them.  On top of that, with the ease of borrowing library e-books right from the device, I'm already reading far more than I would otherwise, without the expense and clutter of paper books, or having to run back and forth from the library.

I have a tablet that refuses to stay awake and therefore denies me a pleasure reading let alone a good multimedia experience. The Customer service is slack and there is no sense of follow up. This even as I continue to pay installments for the device. This was one sorry investment for me. And I recommend that those in India refrain from investing in this tablet.",3/02/2015,0

But I've had it less than a month and suddenly the amazon prime video app  won't work. I have been on the phone for an hour with 3 different representatives I could barely understand and and they are at a loss. They said they would submit a ticket to engineering and someone would get back to me in 48 hours.  I'm really disappointed and ready to send it back and get a Samsung.  I got the 7 to watch prime on because my 1st generation fire (which is still going strong) can't play prime movies. So basically I just got another kindle to watch Netflix in better sound and color. Love amazon. But this will be my last kindle. I'm gonna get an android tablet next time. Smh >>>UPDATE>>>> Talked to a technician instead of customer service and he had it fixed in like 3 minutes.

Truthfully I wasn't sure if I really wanted or not. However, I have come to love my kindle. I used to think my laptop was convenient. But my kindle is THE definition of convenient. If I want to Google something real quick, shop on Amazon, oh and thing is made for Amazon prime; I take advantage of my prime membership way more now than I used to. I have watched movies on here and the picture is so crisp. I wasn't expecting such HD quality. I can lay in bed at night and read a book without the bedside lamp on so it doesn't bother my husband. I can adjust the brightness of the screen so it's not so bright. You have the option to change the background color while reading a book. I changed my background to black and the words are written in white so it's much easier on my eyes. I figured out that when your typing out, like writing a review, you don't even have to lift your finger off the screen. All you have to do is move your finger across the screen to all the letters and it knows what you're trying to type out. My kindle has made it very easy to keep up with Facebook. And I have become obsessed with pinterest. There are fun games you can download and play. Some of my favorites are the slots. You can download all kinds of apps and books and keep them in your cloud instead of on your kindle so it doesn't slow down your device. The only reason I didn't give my kindle a five star rating it's because sometimes it freezes up. I have a feeling this my have more to do with some of the apps rather than the performance of the kindle but I'm not sure. Now that I have a kindle I'm not sure what I would do without it. I'm so glad I got this as a gift and I highly recommend everybody have one, especially if you have Amazon prime.",1/02/2015,1

My wife got me this for Christmas.  I thought I might find the carousel a bit backward after the Samsung.  I also have a Samsung phone and love using folders on the home screen.    I found the carousel very easy to get used to.  It is an easy interface.  I also like the speed and love the screen resolution.  The screen is slightly wider than the Samsung or Nexus.  This way out-performs my wife's 2012 vintage Nexus 7.  The sound is much stronger than any tablet I have used.  It is clear and its volume will fill a room.  The screen has a type of glass on it that wipes off easily.  It does not collect finger marks.    This is built for video and reading.  It streams well throughout the house whereas we have problems with the Nexus.  It does well with Netflix, YouTube (via the browser) and other video on the internet.  I downloaded the Spirit Clips app and side-loaded the Vudu app.  All work well.    Not all the apps in the Amazon App store are available on the Fire HD.  Some are not compatible.  I downloaded an APK extractor app and got the Vudu and some other apps off my old tablet.  I was disappointed that SwiftKey is not compatible.  I got it loaded but it took up too much screen.  I found another keyboard I am just as happy with.    I read and heard negative information on the browser.  I have found it to be as good as any other tablet browser.

The main Admin profile has full control over each user profile settings. I have restricted all app purchases under my son's account, so I never have to worry about any unauthorized purchases.

I bought 2 of these Kindle Fire HD7 8GB and my boys' storage was critically low and wifi automatically kept turning off by the first week. I called Amazon to get clarification on what is taking up so much space, since nothing within the settings for storage came close to even 1G. Then I started questioning why the space was considered 'critically low' when only 4.3G was showing as being used.... what happened to the other 3.8G? Sure, no device actually has the full storage capacity for your own personal use, but WOW almost 1/2 of the entire space of the Kindle Fire HD 7 is used just to run/operate the Kindle? Had I known this I would have just purchased the 16G from the start. When I stated I wanted to do return these 8G kindles and buy 2 new 16G kindles, (but I had initially purchased on sale with $25.00 discount) the Amazon customer service rep told me that she could give me a $25.00 Credit for each kindle to return them and purchase the 16G. I asked a 2nd time to be sure that she was able to apply the $25.00 credit twice (1 for each kindle) and she replied with 'yes, the $25.00 credit will be applied for each Kindle, so $50.00 total.' ... UNFORTUNATELY THIS NEVER HAPPENED! I was told they could only apply the $25.00 credit ONCE after I was just told TWO TIMES that it would be no problem to credit for both. Now mind you, I am known for being a Amazon spokesperson. I am constantly raving about how great Amazon is and I have told hundreds and hundreds of people to sign up for Amazon Prime. I have &#62;6 Amazon devices and spend thousands of dollars with Amazon each year... yet they won't follow through with giving me what they originally told me (twice) which was $25.00 credit to my account for each device. This was escalated to 2 supervisors and the answer was still NO. WOW!!! my mind has vastly changed about you Amazon!!! I would have spent more than the $25.00 by buying 2 more EXPENSIVE kindles. But now I'm about to just return both kindlesand go someplace else for a tablet and after all of this I plan not spend another dime at Amazon.... just another giant conglomerate company who has lost sight of values and how to have good customer service and is only concerned about greed and profiting. Best of luck to you Amazon, you just lost a customer. And remember how many people I talked to about how great you were!!! I'll keep talking, but my comments won't be positive.",29/01/2015,0

I needed a tablet to access recipes (tired of lugging my laptop to the kitchen to cook), wanted it to fit in my purse, or easily stowed for traveling, and i love to read so it had to have a reading app. I am very happy with what i got. I initially got the 6HD and a week later the 7HD dropped to the price I paid. Amazon gladly exchanged my device so i upgraded to the 7. I use it all the time in the kitchen, have taken it with me on trips, and use it to read. I also realized that i could use it for music and movies! I am a prime member and it is so awesome to have all of these features. Sometimes I get annoyed because I have to have wifi to utilize a lot of the features, but that would be the same problem if I were to get an iPad or Samsung tablet. I love my kindle and am happy i didn't pay an arm and a leg for it. SILK web browser works great and doesn't glitch as other users have said.

EVERY TIME.<br />3- because the kindle is tied to your amazon account, your credit card info is already stored into the kindle. which means if you give them access to the amazon store, they can see what you have been looking at. this was almost disastrous during xmas as he could see everything we were looking at and some of the things were for him.<br />4- also because the kindle is tied to your amazon account, when my son renamed his device to his name amazon decided to rename my account as well.<br />the kindle is fine if you are buying for yourself or as a glorified reader. otherwise i found the settings difficult to configure and interface confusing to navigate. could be that i'm just too used to my ipad.<br />anyway, this device ended up on ebay (where it sold for 30% less) and he's saving up to get an ipad mini.",29/01/2015,0

It's lightweight, and you don't have to take it out of your bag with security at the airport like you do with a laptop.  It also takes a lot less room.  Perfect for emailing on the road, reading and surfing the web.  Typing on it is a bit of a learning curve, and you need to read what you have written before you send (big fingers, small keyboard on the screen), but you pick up two-fingered typing quickly.  It suggests words as you type based on what you are writing, which cuts down some of the tapping.  The screen adjusts horizontally or vertically and is sharp and clear.  It even takes nice photos.  And, the charge holds for a good while.  I still love my laptop for everyday use at home, but I also love my Fire.

Ok, may not seem that way to an iPhone user, but for someone like me who's never had a &#34;smart phone&#34;, this little tablet is really cool!  I find myself using the Kindle more than I used to use my laptop PC.  Checking email is dead easy, it's easier to read my digital RC magazine on the Kindle than it is on the laptop, and typing on the Kindle is really easy thanks to the on-screen keyboard.  The &#34;word suggestions&#34; that are displayed across the top of the &#34;keyboard&#34; are context sensitive, and it makes typing even easier.  I can lay the tablet on my knees, in landscape mode, and type almost as easily as I can on the laptop.  The learning curve on this device is pretty easy.<br /><br />What was really surprising was that I found all the CDs I've bought from Amazon over the last few years IN THE &#34;CLOUD&#34;. As long as I have a WiFi connection, I have access to all these CDs!  Woah!  WiFi sensitivity is very good, better than my laptop.  It's essentially a smart phone without the phone, AND WITHOUT THE MONTHLY CHARGES OF A SMARTPHONE.  (We'd looked into getting a smart phone so my wife could use an iSquare card reader at some art shows she participates in, and the cheapest plan was $60/mo.)  Of course, having access to Amazon on the Kindle and being able to buy anything at the drop of a hat is another story. 8^)  I have to watch myself.  But I DID find a couple CDs I've been looking for for like twenty years!<br /><br />So, now I feel like I'm truly in the 21st Century, I have a &#34;smart device&#34; like most other people in the world now, but on MY terms, no monthly charges, and it's, like, totally Star Trek-cool!!",28/01/2015,1

Glad I bought it but I will also continue to use the original Kindle Fire that came out in 2011 for reading books because the screen is easier on the eyes (with the tan screen that I call up). When I call up the tan screen on the Fire HD 7, the screen is still too bright for comfort - at least to my eyes. The dual speakers give a better sound quality to the Fire HD 7 so I can listen to audiobooks and streamed films without turning off the nearby fan, which I have to do with the original Kindle Fire where you have to turn off the fan or any other distraction to be able to hear the films.<br /><br />About audiobooks, another drawback to the Fire HD 7 is the fact there's so much EXTRA stuff on it, that it stops downloading audiobooks from Audiobooks.com and gives you a message that it can't download due to too much content on your device.<br /><br />And when it does download, it takes a half hour to download (as with my most recent download of a book that wasn't overly long). On the original Kindle Fire, the downloads are much faster and I've never been told there's too much content on my device. I didn't think I had too much content on the Fire HD 7, just all the items packed on the device plus a few extra things I downloaded to the Carousel (a few magazines, books, a one-minute video taken by the Fire HD 7 camera). So to get my audiobook to open, I had to delete other additions to the Carousel.<br /><br />If my message seems convoluted, I apologize, but what I've been talking about is a big deal to me and I don't like being annoyed by having so much crap on the Fire HD 7 from programs I have no intention of using. In short, I have to retain the three year old original Kindle Fire in conjunction with the new Fire HD 7 to get all my entertainment needs met. Still, the Fire HD 7 is much faster in downloads for Facebook posts and opening Yahoo email and in browsing news sites than the original Kindle Fire. How could the developers of the Fire HD 7 make it more difficult to use in some ways and better in others? In short, don't throw away the old device, it's still good for many things.use in some ways and better in others?

My husband and I looked at so many different kinds of tablets because as you probably know there are 100's to choose from.  We finally decided on the Kindle Fire HD....why you ask.....My husband and I try to really pay attention to what are kids see and do and with getting a tablet we were concerned with internet (and all that can pop up) and too much use of the tablet.  We decided out of all the tablets that we saw that the parental controls (which included setting time limits for books, apps, and videos and you can even set it to where they can't do anything else but read until there reading is finished) were one of the best we had seen (without getting a kiddy tablet).  We also looked at the fact that amazon still has a great deal of choices as far as the books, apps, and videos.  Some tablets don't have a very good selection.<br />We have now had the tablets for about a month and the kids love them and we love them!!!  They have their set time to play and they play and get off.  The tablets hold a good charge.  I did get cases for them before the kids were allowed to use them for protection but other than that you take the tablet out and it's pretty much really to download stuff and be used!!!",27/01/2015,1

Worst purchase ever.,"I'm very disappointed with the Fire. I've already went through three different devices and all have the same problems: after some weeks it is very difficult to charge them. At some point, I just stop using them. I have never had this problem with Apple products, including the IPAD, no matter how old they are.<br />I've been an Amazon client for 15 years, I have Prime and consume a lot of its content. After contacting customer support to see if there was some way to solve the annoying problems to charge the battery, they recognized that the Fire has this known problem but since it seems that they do not have a solution or the device cannot be fixed they offered to sell me a DISCONTINUED REFURBISHED model at a small discount from the price offered online. I'm now more disappointed about the whole experience.  You can judge by yourself, this is a copy of the chat I had with customer support (btw, to add insult to injury, Amazon never sent me the copy of the chat as they should and it is confirmed in the chat, I took the precaution of copying it, I obviously changed the names):<br /><br />Me: I have several problems to charge my kindle fire.

I have had several versions of the 7in and this one was on sale as a 7in HD not the HDX but it had both front facing and rear facing camera but it did lack the ability to have a data plan. Upon receiving the Kindle it was immediately apparent that the materials used in the making of the Kindle were far subpar with other devices I have used. THe back is a cheap plastic material. The other thing I loved about my kindle was the operating system and the silk browser. Other devices had a lag time and I never had to wait for anything. I clicked on a book and BAM..there is was. Using the key board is also a pain in the you know what. It is like it has a stuttering problem. I feel like banging my head on the wall when I try to type anything because of the lag. You can touch a key and it can take up to thirty seconds for it to light up and show up on the screen. Why oh why is this happening?? I am not rich enough to buy one of the newer HDX's but if they are anything like this one , I am not sure what to do. The silk browser even hiccups all the time. One the plus side the speakers are louder than I have ever herd them. I hate the fact that I have to dump on my kindle because Amazon and their products and company profile have me wishing I could be apart of this company.  I am in the process of trying to review every product but more importantly to review books. I have over six hundred in my kindle library but that does not even come close to the real number. I have thousands of things to review, and I hope that Amazon understands that all I want is for them to succeed. I love the power that Amazon has brought to writers and hope one day I will be using their services as well.Amazon needs to do themselves a favor and not sell this product anymore ...its quality is beneath them. And dont get me started on the shipping problems we have been having. This product came three days late as well as other products.

BUT know what you are getting and what you are getting in to. I like the tablet,even knowing full well that it was going to be somewhat limited in comparison to a Galaxy Tab or a Nexus Tablet. There are some apps that are unavailable and some apps that are just behind the main android release version. With that expectations set, here is my 2 cents.<br /><br />The Good:<br />The tablet feels really solidly made.<br />The Fire fits in my hand easily and is easy to hold on to.<br />The screen quality and responsiveness is great.<br />The speakers are REALLY GOOD all things considered.<br />The ability to set up a child profile is great. Especially since I can control what my kids see.<br />The Amazon instant video and Prime music work really well on this.<br />It integrates perfectly with the Fire TV stick for watching something cast to my TV or if I wanted to start on tablet and then lay down and watch on TV.<br /><br />The NOT great:<br />I feel the battery life is not very good. My wife's iPad EASILY outlasts this thing 4x as long. Even my phone doing the same things would be 2x as long.<br />The limited app store feels lackluster in comparison to the Google Play Store.<br />Amazon Instant video selection is unclear what is free and what you have to buy in some of the menus.<br />Pushing an app to the device from the Amazon website, while usually works well, sometimes is clunky and delayed for no apparent reason. (Thereby forcing a refresh of purchased apps from my settings menu.)<br /><br />I think the tablet itself is OUTSTANDING for the price, but I knew what to expect going in. A solid tablet that can carry out fairly basic functions and while limited, has an integrated app store.",26/01/2015,1

I do wish Id gotten the one with more room in it though.. kicking myself for that. I didnt realize teh OS took u as muhc room as it does but at least we can put things in the cloud. I was used ot having 600 book on my kindle so was surprised when I coudnt put lots of things on here liek music adn games.. I had one movie, 4 books and 5 games and a few magazines nad was running out of room so I ahd to delete most of them. Fomr now on I'll be putting one book at a time since its so eay to go thru all of my book on my account . I do love that! I can see the covers nad when I open a book It has a little box with a explanation of what the book is about and page count and all that.. on my kindle all I got was the name and author! not even the book cover unless I opened it and went back to the cover( they open to the first page in the chapter)<br />I havent really figured out hte games yet as I jsut havent had time. I dont have a smart phone so havent played any of these kinds of games nad I ahvent played a compuyter game in years so this will be fun! but Im not sure how many I can have on it at one time.. can I save a game in the cloud? I dont knwo how that works yet. I also love the music and I will be getting a speaker for this.. not that the speakers are that bad for listening if your holding it but if your across the room its just not loud enough. I still havn had time ot ck out a lot of how it works and all the things you can do but I have found it does a heck of a lot mroe than I ahd thought it did! I also didn't think Id like to watch a movie on such a small screen but it swasnt bad at all! surprised me actually so I may be keeping the prime account ( you get it free for a month) I had no idea you could watch movies for free and also didn't know you could download music for free too! that right there is worth it! I got it to replace my kindle which was locking up more often and I didnt leik I couldnt find out what the book was about becuse they have no descriptions on my old one.. so this was a really good surprise! well with the cost! but if you want to do alot with it.. get the larger spaced one with 16 GBs. I wish you coudl add on more but maybe htey will figure out how to make them expandable someday. Oh and you will want a cover so you can hold it and prop it up while reading or watching it though I ordered a bundle so I get a buch of things with it.",26/01/2015,1

There is no Youtube app, because it like a lot of other app is associated with Google. which is a big grievance of mine. If Apple and Android has it so should Amazon. I have counted 12 apps that I have one my android phone, as well as my mothers Ipad that can't even be downloaded and installed on this &#34;tablet&#34;<br /><br />-Sound Quality: There is one speaker and it quieter than my smart phone.<br />-Immersion reading with Audible- It really suck, I enjoyed it a lot on my phone and really looked forward to it on my kindle,but I will not be using it. The one speaker that comes with this kindle plays the audible books at such a very low level it has to be close to my face to hear making it hard to read. I talked with both Amazon and Audible about this and they said nothing can be done because the kindle is made that way.<br /><br />-Lack of customization: You can not change the background or lock screen at all. I know it's petty but with the price I pay for this I should be able to do such a simple thing like that. If the knock off brands of tablets and phones can do it I expect a name brand product like one from a company as big as Amazon to be able to do it as well.",26/01/2015,0

I purchased this for my stepson for Christmas and he absolutely loves it!<br />Pros: Everything was pretty easy to set up, added my kid's preferences and apps fairly easy. I am not as pleased with free time as I thought I would be, but the functions that only allow your child on during certain times and only allow them to play for certain amounts of time are great :)<br /><br />Cons: The biggest ding I see is the fact that in Freetime there is no option to have books read aloud! This is the biggest reason for 4 stars vs 5. I can do it in the regular (non-freetime) portion of Kindle, but this is lacking in FreeTime. I found a book or two that will do this, however, there is no way of knowing until you have waited the ridiculous amount of time for it to download. My stepson is 5, so he can only read very easy level 1 books, but he loves Ninja Turtles and other books that are far above his reading level, so not being able to listen in FreeTime is a big bummer. Also, we download ALOT of library books, and not only will it not read them to him in Freetime, but everytime we get new books from library I have to go into apps for Free Time and add the books. Honestly, I purchased this product over an ipad mini because of the &#34;free time&#34; portion for kids. However, it is not as amazing as I would like it to be. The &#34;learning apps&#34; are pretty mediocre at best. I found much better ones in the app store. Also, apps and books take forever to download vs app store apps for some reason. Also, for some reason audiobooks I have downloaded in Overdrive App do not show up in free time, but this could just be a precaution so kids aren't reading inappropriate material, so technically a pro.<br /><br />Overall, the tablet is WONDERFUL!! I would definitely recommend this over the kid's version tablet that is all in Free Time.",25/01/2015,1

So the integration between my Kindle and my Amazon account was seamless.<br /><br />What I have not liked: I think I was expecting more than the Kindle could provide. I thought the Kindle would be more powerful and useful than a smartphone and less powerful than a laptop.  In all honesty, the Kindle is basically a larger version of my Samsung Galaxy but with fewer features. I can not change the background on the log in screen. So whenever I log onto my Kindle, I see a advertisement for something Kindle, or one of their vendors, is trying to sell. This Kindle has a small amount of memory.  I think my phone (which is 2 years old) has more memory.  Why sell a new device that is already behind current technology?<br /><br />Overall, I think the Kindle is fair.  If you have a good lap top and great smart phone with a large screen, good sound, a nice camera, tons of storage and good speed you really don't need a Kindle. If you just like to have a new toy, for the price, it's okay.",25/01/2015,0

I have the 2nd Kindle Fire and it's so much better, and built sturdier. I thought this would be a great upgrade, not so. It's not all bad, though. I love the sidebar slider when reading a book that gives you the table of contents and book details, such as description, etc. I do love the fact that I get my book Collections now on this device. Old Fire didn't have that feature (which I have on my iPad Kindle app). The bookmarks/notes access is better and I love that. I edit my own books on it, and it's easier to get to my notes and bookmarks. I love the Prime Music app...so far it works flawless. The screen resolution is great. The email app is equivalent. No complaints there and works well for my Yahoo and Gmail accounts. I haven't yet used it for video. The speakers are decent for a small device.<br /><br />The bad:<br />The browser is just as slow as my old 3 year old Fire. I was hoping to get a faster browser. Nope. If I'm in my Facebook app and I click on a link, I'll be lucky to get anything on the browser page, half the time it's just a blank page.<br /><br />Battery: worst ever. My old Fire hasn't been charged in 2 weeks and its in standby mode and still has a 75% charge. This thing barely lasts 4 days in standby mode. It'll last a little longer in airplane mode, but not much. Just reading a couple hours on the device and occasionally checking Facebook and email, I have to charge it every other day. And it takes over 4 hours for a full charge from about 10%...way longer than the old Fire.<br /><br />Books don't always download properly, i.e. I click and click on it and it doesn't do anything. When I delete a book, I sometimes have to power off completely for the book to remove itself from the device.<br /><br />And why do random app icons keep showing up on my home page slider? I like to keep my slider clean with only the apps I'm using. But every day, there are random Kindle and funny little screen apps showing up. I delete them and they come right back.

I?? amazed at how great the sound is. I?? a heavy Kindle user with over 2,000 books, and the Fire HD 7 replaces a Fire HD (3rd gen). Most of my irritations stem from the most recent software update:<br /><br />1. Many of the things I often do on my Kindle Fire now take two or three clicks instead of one click. Really unhappy about this--why would Amazon make the Fire LESS convenient to use?<br /><br />2. Since I use my Kindle mostly as a reader, it's a big problem when books won't open. Some books take longer to open or start to open then close again multiple times. This never happened before the latest upgrade.<br /><br />3. Another annoyance within the Kindle app is the new response when text is selected. Wikipedia/Translation/Dictionary seems to be the same, but the line of symbols above the selected text has been changed: &#34;Search in Book&#34; and &#34;Search the Web&#34; have been buried in a dot pile. Perhaps I'm an anomaly, but I use both of those a lot, so it's an extra click each time--not a lot of extra work, but annoying just the same when it takes two clicks to do what you're used to doing with one click.<br /><br />Something I wish the program had is a sound for battery-low and battery-charged. I use it primarily as a reader, although I look up a lot of info online as well. When I'm reading, the battery icon doesn't show, so I have to leave the story to find out whether the battery level is low.  Since it now dings when it starts or stops charging, how about adding sounds that will really help readers keep using the product without interruptions? When my phone battery gets to 5%, I get a noise to remind me to charge the phone; when the battery gets to 100%, the phone makes a little rumble so I know it's time to unplug it. I wish the Kindle did something similar.<br /><br />The biggest annoyance is actually on the Amazon site: The floating menu on &#34;Manage My Content and Devices&#34; floats down so low,hardly any of the list can be seen on a Kindle held horizontally. And it jumps in fits and starts which makes it even harder to see what's there or to click on an item. I use my Kindle horizontally most of the time, and this page looks like it really wasn't designed with the user in mind. Somebody wanted to do something slick, but it doesn't work for the consumer; the dropdown takes half the screen but sadly contributes almost nothing to page utility since it's mostly unused space. This really should be better.<br /><br />I??e written to Customer Service about these issues and get a response that indicated either they didn?? really read what I wrote or they didn?? understand the words I used. If Amazon really wants to be ??arth's Most Customer-Centric Company,??Customer Service needs to do a better job.",25/01/2015,0

I asked for the Fire Tablet as a Christmas present since I have the Fire TV and the Fire Stick and both are wonderful.  I figured this would work out great.  I was sorely mistaken.<br /><br />I will first talk about what I do like about the tablet.  It is small, easy to use, and works well with Prime.  It also makes a great remote for both the Fire TV and Fire Stick.  The picture on it is pretty decent.  I have been able to load and play music and videos that I love to use.  The camera works pretty good - better than my phone for sure.  Lightweight, and not a whole lot to it... as I said before, easy to use.<br /><br />Now for the problems.  First, there needs to be some updates.  I thought at first that it just wasn't updating, but as it turns out it had, and was up to date.  And with that I mean most of the apps that I use, for instance gmail.  This is a common and popular app that should be updated.  Yes, I realize that the app maker is the one who has to release an update, but if they don't feel like it is worth their time, then they wont.  It still doesn't change the fact that the app is out of date and it is better to use my phone, computer, Ipad, or other Tablet in the house instead.  One of the biggest issues is the battery life.  I am not sure if there is just something wrong with my battery, but it doesn't last for anything.  I get about 4 hours at best-and I don't mean with a constant video playing either.  I bought for my kids - 2 Sero tablets, and a half Defunct Vizio tablet.  All three of them have a battery life of about 6-8 hours.  I thought maybe I was overdoing the tiny tablet, so I charged it all night, it said a 100%, I left for work after putting it to sleep, I came home and it said 10%.  Not sure why it would drain all day while in sleep/standby mode.  I have looked up multiple answers and none of them work.<br /><br />Now, one of the greatest things about the Fire Tablet is the remote control... only it really takes some getting use to.  It is very touchy and finicky.  I have since purchased 1 random episode of Sponge Bob Square pants that I did not want.  Also, when I use the Fire TV remote app on the tablet, for some reason the screen will revert to the small upper corner preview video while in Netflix.  At first I didn't thing that was possible, it had to be with the TV.  However, trying to diagnose how and why that happens, I could definitively say that it only happens when I use the Tablet as a remote.<br /><br />When I contacted technical support, I got simple answers - yes, that is normal.  Or, no, we haven't heard of that, I will get back to you and I was not contacted back.  I have never had to deal with support since everything else I have gotten was awesome.  Not really sure if I want to bother.<br /><br />These issues make this a very hard sell.  I am glad it was a present and I didn't spend the money on it.  It is definitely over priced for what you get.  Compared to all the other tablets I have (minus the Ipad because it's on a different tier with price and hardware) that have a comparable price, I would not purchase this again, nor would I recommend it to any of my family or friends.<br /><br />Amazon really missed the mark.  I was so happy with everything else I have gotten from then, I just didn't think this could be that far off.  Not to mention, when my brother ordered it, it was supposed to be here by Christmas, but I didn't get it until after.<br /><br />At time of purchase, was supposed to be here December 17.  Then was back ordered to January 17.  Came in early January, but was shipped to my brother's address instead of mine.  Yes we double checked that my address was on the where it was supposed to go address.  We freaked out because he called me and let me know that it was left on my porch.  But it wasn't on my porch.  He looked up on Amazon and it was supposed to go to my address, but then on the UPS it showed Amazon had hisaddress.  We thought it was stolen, but was sitting on his porch (he parks and enters his place through his garage).<br /><br />The whole ordeal was not one I would want anyone to go through.  I would wait and see if they are going to make any changes that will improve multiple issues, and some common place issues that you would think customers would want taken care of from the get go.",23/01/2015,0

Overall it's probably a fantastic value.  However, I'm really not a fan of the UI, specifically the carousel home screen and I'd be fine with that if I could choose favorite apps or books but showing me front and center ten things I took a peek at in passing isn't really a time saver.  Now if Amazon would unlock the bootloader this would be an amazing amount of bang for your buck with great longevity, but maybe that's the problem.  The Amazon store side integration isn't bad especially the store search in the app menu but I keep opening the main Amazon app when I'm looking for books or apps because there's nothing to distinguish them aside from context.  Unlock the bootloader and this would probably be the best value tablet on the market, those that would take advantage of it are probably few and it would make them very content.",23/01/2015,0

We have three kindle readers in our home (starting with a 2nd gen that still works great up to a current touch screen version), as well as a Fire TV, and we have had a prime account for years, so I thought having a Kindle Fire would be an excellent addition to our selection.  It has an excellent picture, decent sound and is user friendly.  However, I cannot give it more than 3 stars (its just OK) because it locks up on a regular basis.  There is no rhyme nor reason as to when or why it will happen.  Sometimes it locks up immediately when I open it, sometimes right in the middle of reading a book, or browsing Amazon.  Sometimes it won't turn on at all.  Anyway, I have to give it a hard boot (press and hold down the power) to reset it all the time.  Its quite annoying.  I haven't put many apps on it at all.

Unfortunately there are just too many issues to give it more of a rating than 3 stars.  Dont get me wrong, its a well built, nice feeling tablet.  The OS is pretty nice and fairly user friendly but so are many other options out there.  One issue with this is that you don't get Amazon's incredible service unless you buy the HDX version. They really should provide this with all of their newer devices.  My biggest issue is that not all software works on a Kindle. My phone can run several well put together applications designed for the Android OS that Amazon doesn't even provide, even though they work flawlessly on several other Android devices. But why not Kindle?  Even if i look past that and shop for the Apps that Amazon does allow and deem compatible for Kindle, literally half of what I've downloaded for my kindle from Amazon wont work. Why? You'd think if they go through some crazy process to allow only certain products on the Kindle that they'd make sure those products actually work with their Kindles.  Crazy how that is.  Several apps crash and freeze the tablet to the point where you have to hard power off the device just so you can use it.  Crazy!  Lastly, the profiles are a very nice feature except that they still have a lot of work.  Its very time consuming to have the Admin download and install software then make it usable for each profile but understandable. But some things only work under the main admin account, not under profiles.  I want my son to be able to watch Amazon Prime when he's on it but in his profile it isnt available.  I can download movies we've purchased and make only the downloaded movies available to him but not the streaming Prime movies or shows.  Its pretty crazy... maybe I'm missing something but I've looked all over for a setting and nothing can be found... this points back to my first issue too, it would be better if Amazon's service would help me out without buying the HDX.

First, I chose the fire over the e Ink because I wanted the whispersync technology for my son, but then I learned that Free Time will not allow whispersync to work, which meant he had to access my account, which pretty much defeated the purpose of Free Time, which, let's face it, was really too juvenile for him anyway.<br /><br />I should add, however, that Free Time is a great option for my daughter who prefers to read rather than listen. We tried out a month of free Unlimited, but we calculated that the small number of apps she enjoyed would be cheaper to purchase.<br /><br />Most disturbing, however, is the frequency of &#34;freezing&#34; on my daughter's fire. My son's works fine, but my daughter's kindle freezes daily, and we have to power it down and start it up again before the touch screen will work.<br /><br />I still have high hopes for the devices once I learn to use them more effectively, but my favorite kindle is still the old e-ink kindle I have from years ago.",16/01/2015,0

But in one area, a very important area it failed.  My wife bought this for me for Christmas, and our Amazon account is in her name and I am on the account as a guest.  So when I went to watch a video through our prime account on my new Fire HD it wanted me to sign up for a new\another Amazon prime account, which we already have one prime account already.  I tried to sign as her on my Fire HD, but since it setup for me it will not allow it.<br />Here's the problem I can go to my computer sign into our account (my wife's sign in) and watch any video through our one account, and this can also be done on any non-Fire HD device, so my question is what advantage is the Fire HD, So be aware that maybe another device would be more advantageous if you already have a Amazon Prime Account, the Fire may not be as versatile as Amazon would have you believe.

I purchased this as a gift for our daughter who is 4 years old and I love the Amazon Free Time aspect of it.  The device is the perfect size for her hands and she enjoys using it however there are a few things that can really bother you.  For instance there is no Google Play store which means you are stuck with the Kindle Apps.  Had I known this (should have done better research) I most likely would have passed on it.  Especially finding out that some of the most popular apps such as Disney Movies Anywhere and Disney Junior are not available/compatible with the Kinds Fire 7 HD!!!  Reading books can become very frustrating not only for a little one but as an adult since you have to use certain gestures to exit the book that are comparable to turning the page.  It takes a few very frustrating try's to get the device back to the home screen.  The Amazon Free time is very useful to monitor what she is using and playing with and the content that you can download is ok.  I really think this device has a huge opportunity to become a leader but without having access to more apps as well as compatible apps in my opinion its just ok.  If Amazon can resolve these issues the Kindle Fire HD can be successful tablet.  Most likely because of those reasons I would have returned it for another product but since the box was thrown away we are using it for the time being.,14/01/2015,0

Either way...this is not a user friendly device!,"There seem to be so many quirks with this device.  The screen was constantly going partially black the first week and my kids were getting very frustrated.  I think I figured out what was going on.  A couple of the apps had not fully loaded so I removed them and reload them onto the device.  It seems to be running a little better but is still running pretty slow.<br /><br />I set the tablet up so that the kids would each have their own profile and I would have my own profile as the main account.  It was laborious setting it up.  Once I loaded all the apps onto the tablet through my account, I then had to approve which child could play with each app.  That was not a problem and relatively easy to do.  But, when they go on the first time to use them it then has to load those same apps into their profiles.  The app is already on the device.  Why does it need to load that app into 4 different profiles???  Does that mean it is taking up 4x the space?<br /><br />I also decided to take advantage of the free month of Amazon Free Time for the kids.  Free time changes their profile screen and adds all the items they can load from Free Time based on their age.  It is overwhelming for them.  Their home page should only have the items that they have currently loaded on their profile.  Maybe it is user error and I'm just not doing it right.  Not sure.<br /><br />I cannot load a lot of the apps that my kids like because they are not in the Amazon Store.  I didn't realize that was going to be the case.  There are even some apps that I use that I cannot get.  Very frustrating.<br /><br />I am seriously considering returning the device because I feel like there is some internal glitch in it that causing it to run slow and for apps to sit in limbo and not load.  Any advice from other Fire HD owners would be welcome in comments under this post.  I am gonna give it another week.  If it is user error I would love to figure out the quirks of this device.

I read through some of the very well written reviews and from everything I read, the price point and the 2 year warranty, we were happy with our decision.  That's until we've had the chance to use these on a daily basis since Christmas.    Everyday, yes, everyday the wifi is turned off (an automatic feature) because there isn't enough space.  Daily, I have to go through & delete everything so the wifi can be turned back on and the kids can play. How many apps could my kids download that would cause this daily?  That's a great question since they aren't able to download apps, they are just playing the already available games on it. Is it pictures by chance?  Not necessarily.  However, if they do have a selfie session as kids love to do, you'll be having a storage issue multiple times during their daily allotted time.  Why wouldn't my kids be able to play without wifi?  I can still play games and access things on my iPad w/out wifi. Zoodles (an app similar to \\""FreeTime\\"") will still work w/out wifi, of course some apps won't play but, many still will.  Well, FreeTime, (the app that keeps them locked into the \\""safe\\"" area) will not work without wifi at all, AT ALL!!!! so my children initially kept getting frustrated thinking they had broken it or it had gone bad and I have to fix the storage AGAIN and turn the wifi back on AGAIN.    Also, I didn't realize how much I would want to \\""push\\"" certain apps into the educational category.  Of course it makes good business sense to only have \\""book\\"" (good call Kindle/Amazon.  Good call. I bet your stockholders are happy with that one.) apps count as education however, we are working on phonics, writing, math, letter recognition all of which I should be able to indicate that I want these apps to be accessed during the \\""education only\\"" time allotment.  My six year old needs beginner base level reading books, her age selection evidently puts her at more advanced booksand education time only lets her read.... She quickly gets bored and frustrated and wants to do something else.    We also had the first Kindle freeze w/in a few hours and after two TS calls (the first promised a return call & never called back!) discovered it was a system hardware issue and TS refused to comment if this was a high occurring issue (integrity issue/red flag!).  Of course they issued a replacement Kindle however, whether or not it's new or a refurbished, I can't be sure, I haven't researched that.    We've had these for nineteen days so far and the android \\""lag\\"" is already evident and showing.  Also, many popular apps aren't Kindle friendly.  Google Play also isn't an option.  Play nice Amazon, nobody likes haters.    The positives: that warranty.  However, with the frustrations make it totally not worth it, IMO.    Lesson: Returning these for a full refund and paying an extra $79 for iPad minis plus the cost of a case because the fluidity, the memory, the camera, high selection of quality kid apps loaded to apple platform first just make it a better choice for me and my family.  Plus OSMO is only available with iPads, my kids LOVE that app.",13/01/2015,0

It was affordable, fairly fast, and of fairly high quality. However, my personal freedoms outweigh Amazon's obsession with their walled-garden Appstore service that has none of the applications that actually serveany purpose to me. With the recent update, Amazon appears to have done nothing but unroot my device, delete most of my applications and important data, and give me some free music, presumably in an attempt to satiate my undoubted rage that whenceforth ensued. I understand that rooting your device is against Amazon's Terms of Service involving the device, but going out of one's way to take away the customer's rights involving their own piece of hardware, and in turn taking away one of the most important traits of any Linux system: freedom, is simply and undeniably horrible business practice. I am one whose philosophies involving software are that above all else, the ability to have the freedom to do whatever one must to achieve their goals is absolutely essential. This is why I use Linux. It has become clear to me that Amazon does not care for the only reasons Android exists, through managing to not make their system open, and also managing to make the software you install on it locked as well. I will cease using Amazon products completely once I procure enough money to buy a new tablet. In the meantime, I will attempt to order a factory cable from which to load CyanogenMod onto my device, an action I was going to do anyways, but seems to have been rushed in Amazon's removal of my personal digital liberties. I hope this serves as a warning to those few who realize the importance of these types of things that I, for one, cannot stand for any longer.",13/01/2015,0

We try to limit our kids exposure to electronics and thought this was the perfect choice as freetime would allow us to set times and would automatically turn off. Boy were we wrong. Freetime has been a complete joke. It never keeps time properly, sometimes will pass 15 mins in about 2 and their time is up. Sometimes I will turn the time on or off and it will go back to how it was before. So, I may have set a time limit and I turn around and the kids are still playing because the time limits have turned themselves off. One kid may end up playing and the time goes off too quick and the other doesn't so they don't understand why one gets more time than the other. That was the entire purpose of choosing this particular device. If I wanted them to have free reign I would've bought something else. Freetime does seem to at least adhere to the app so that they can't get out of it and onto the Internet or whatever else but it is still super annoying that the app rarely works properly with the timing. It will also not allow any &#34;bundles&#34; to be added onto games which my kids were bummed about. I spent probably 5 hours total on the phone with people at Amazon trying to get things to work and they never have so I finally gave up. I even emailed in the logs from the device and they told me I shouldnt have any more timing issues but they continue. The only thing I know to do is completely delete the freetime app and load it again. I haven't tried that yet.....",13/01/2015,0

I called Amazon tech support and the only way around this is to buy a 3rd party app for the calculator or email, as you can't get the default Kindle apps to work in the child / teen profiles.  The other alternative was to create an adult profile for the kids, but that requires me to create separate Amazon accounts for them.  Another complaint is the time limit settings per day.  The time limits differentiate between reading, video and apps.  Unfortunately, all apps are the same so even if they're using a \\""good\\"" app like a math program, that uses their time.  Once they run out of time there's no way for me to add say another 30 minutes for the day.  My only option is to either increase their time allowance overall, or disable it altogether.

The reason for the one-star is not for it's actual performance -- which, unfortunately, I never really was able to enjoy -- but instead is for the fact this Kindle Fire is  just a dud. Perhaps that's the reason they were practically given away this past holiday season.<br /><br />The battery never fully charges (and there was also no way to know if it WAS charging -- it certainly never popped up stating it WAS fully charged. But I have no way of knowing if that is even something this Kindle does, because there is not a user guide)<br /><br />After charging, the Kindle would operate for less than one day. It would then take TWO days to re-charge!! TWO days!  Was it the charger?<br />Hmmm... the charger was generic in nature, no way to tell if was OEM. It wasn't wrapped in the package. I tried different charger. A message would pop up with each charger stating charger was &#34;low flow&#34; and indicating the Kindle couldn't be used while attached to the charger.  Not sure how much longer a &#34;low flow&#34; charger would take than the Kindle charger because I didn't want to take a chance it would harm the device.<br /><br />I am sorry to say this but, I am pretty sure this was re-conditioned and not new. The box was NOT sealed. There were no directions, user guide or anything accompanying the item but it's unwrapped, unsealed charger.<br /><br />My bad, I threw out the packaging. It is doubtful there would be a successful return because of this. Did I even try. No. First to admit, I didn't even make the effort.  Why:  Lately, my returns w/ Amazon have been less than satisfactory, and my contribution to the return of this item will most likely cost me more time than I am willing to give.<br /><br />So that's my review.

I have an original black and white Kindle that is an original book only version, and a first generation Kindle Fire.  I purchased the Fire HD 7 because I thought that not only would I have the latest and greatest video ability, but everything including my apps from my previous Kindle Fire would transfer over to the new HD.  That was a mistake.  Not only did it not transfer some of my books, but the primary program that I use to store all of my photos on my Kindle and my iphone was incompatable with the Kindle Fire HD, and you know what that program was, the AMAZON CLOUD DRIVE.  So now, instead of having one Kindle to take with me for videos, books, and photo storage, I have to carry two everywhere I go.  What sense does that make??  And, how could Amazon, the company that makes this device, have its own Cloud Drive unable to access it???  How dumb does it sound that I have the Amazon Cloud Drive on my iphone and on every other phone, laptop and desktop available, but IT IS NOT COMPATABLE with its own brand?????  If I had know that in the beginning I would have never purchased this device until it was able to do what its previous model could do.  Maybe when Amazon reviews this information, someone will go back and update their cloud drive app.  Right now this is a disaster and a waste of money as far as I am concerned",12/01/2015,0

However, the way Amazon has made their OS, does not allow for much customization and only most 3rd party applications will work in this tablet.<br /><br /> My 2nd gripe is that I would not like to use a credit card and it appears the the only way to download an app through Amazon's app store is to have a credit card number (even for free apps), once again, Google play for example will let you download any app and only the apps that cost money they will accept credit cards or gift cards...<br /><br /> There are ways around this, I can connect the kindle to a PC and load apps and music and books, etc. Onto my device, but that defeats the whole purpose of having tablet if I have to rely on the computer constantly to load media onto it.<br /><br />Unfortunately for the latest kindle, there are no means of rooting your device, so Google play is not an option to have directly on your kindle fire tablet.<br /><br />One last thing. The &#34;special offers&#34; are entirely not appreciated and are a bit of a nuisance to see on my lock screen, yes I know you can pay Amazon $15 to take the adds off, still don't like how Amazon does that.<br /><br />So to wrap things up I like the hardware of the tablet, its a pretty slick thing, I just don't like software loaded on the device, which for another $50 I can find an equal competitors tablet running the latest version of android, featuring equally performing hardware and overall is more capable of a tablet",12/01/2015,0

Amazon is trying to provide good options, but they are confusing e.g., I can't figure out what's part for FreeTime subscription vs Prime. Even Prime time content is hard to explore. Skill browser crashes at times and slow to load content at other times. Camera is very low resolution, so even though you get unlimited storage, you can get better quality with smart phones.<br /> I have run into few challenges with usage and support is unable to help. E.g, I created a word doc,  spent and week of hard work, and by accidental swipe, doc vanished. Tech support mentioned point blank - you lost it, no way to recover, next time back it up to cloud. On asking how to backup a doc to cloud, answer was feature does not exist, so email every time you update a doc. Second option given was to restore from backup, on going to backup/restore page, there was no restore option. I was told the feature is not implemented yet, so best way is to reset Fire  to factory default. So using it to create docs/excels is a no no, unless you figure out easy backup option. Other unfriendly thing is switching user profiles - you need to hit power button, and then back again and then choose different user profile.<br />  Also you would expect Fire would make shipping on Amazon easier, but that's not quite easy as said.<br />  Overall, I guess we are spoiled by higher standards set by iPhone/iPads.",12/01/2015,0

But I constantly get asked how to fix something on a Kindle Fire and got tired of saying &#34;I don't know&#34; so I decided to buy this model.  I have to admit, I wanted to see if it matched up to all the hype I hear - and I have to admit, it's got some nice features. In fact, it can do almost the same things as my iPad, even with it's funky navigation.<br /><br />Once I got used to the Carousel, and after observing several children while using the Kindle Fire 7, I'm not as mad about the Carousel as I was at first. Overall the Kindle Fire 7 is nice, and once you know how to find what you want, it's not so frustrating on the surface. I do have minor complaints, , such as, having no physical Home button, which I find almost necessary, especially for a young child old who can't manipulate the screen well enough to get the home button to appear.<br /><br />My main complaint though, is the battery life - and as I said, I have things to compare to: I have 3 other Kindles, plus two iPads for starters. Not one of those units - not even my older iPad 2 nor my Kindle 2, has such a poor battery as this unit does. I can play on my (year old) iPad mini all day long and still have half the battery left. And I use such taxing games as School of Dragons or Rise of Berk as well as keep my email running all the time on the iPad. Yes, these games require sound and motion.  When I play these games on the Kindle I'm lucky to get 3 hours on the unit before that icon turns red - and I do not even run any email on my Kindle at all. I charge it over night, and the next day by noon it's already drained. I do the same thing with my iPad  mini and use it with the same programs for the same amount of time and I can go 3 or more DAYS without a charge.<br /><br />My settings on the Kindle and iPad mini are the same; brightness set at about 40%:  Wifi on. NO headphones. I start the day with a full charge. One game is open at a time (the exception here is that I do use email on my iPad).  The games I play require both Wifi and sound and I prefer not to use headphones - never have used them on my iPad and don't want to start now just because I'm using a Kindle.<br /><br />Video and audio is why I wanted this unit - and when I read suggestions on how to &#34;improve battery life by using headphones instead of the speakers&#34; or &#34;turn off the wifi&#34; I can't help think -- WHAT!!?  that's why people buy this thing!  Many of our games require sound and I do not recommend headphones for children. And what if I'm streaming a movie from Amazon Prime?  I have to use Wifi for that. and if more than one person is watching the movie, what does Amazon want me to do, plug it in? Tether it?  then I lose the portability of the thing.<br /><br />Overall it's a decent tool, and as a second (or third) multi-media device, it's suitable. I do like that it can play so many of the same games and apps available for the iPad (too bad there's no Homer). But I could not depend on this Kindle all day if I use it out in the field, if I'm doing a demo or even just as an electronic organizer, it would be dead by lunch. That just seems lame to me. If the battery were better, I'd give this 4.5 stars and might even consider buying a few more. I still don't like the Carousel or the lack of a physical Home button, but I could live with those things really. With all the other units on the market that have better batteries, I'm just not convinced that the Kindle Fire HD 7 is the one I would suggest when people ask me which Tablet is the one they should get. I guess I'd have to say, if they don't mind charging it several times a day, then it's definitely a decent purchase.here is that I do use email on my iPad).

(Why didn't I just stay with my Nook? Well, it was pretty old, and for whatever reason I could never get it to connect to my wi-fi. It would connect everywhere else, just not to mine. So I thought it was time for an upgrade.) I would have given the Kindle Fire HD 7 5 stars, but I can't customize it the way I want; I can't change the background or lockscreen images on it, and I think it's pretty sad that you have to pay extra to get it without the advertisements on it. Also, the camera is pretty terrible on it. I didn't want this for the camera as I've got a pretty nice camera already, but still. It's pretty bad. If you ever had the original Motorola Razor Phone and took pictures with it, that's about how bad the camera on this is. So, if you're wanting an e-reader that you can customize, change background and lock screen images, NOT have to pay extra to not have advertisements on it, and have a decent camera then this is NOT for you. But, if you want an e-reader that allows you to surf the internet, download certain apps, and listen to music on without all those other things and you don't care if it has ads on it, then I'd get this one as long as it's on sale.

Kindle Kids are just a pre-packaged Kindle Fire HD 6 or 7&#34; 8GB device with 2 year warranty, kindle case and 1 year free time. At the time we bought this the HD 7&#34; they were $79 after some discounts ($237 for all 3). With the 6.99 Family Free time, 3 Kindle kids case (74.97), 3 2 yr Kindle HD 7 warranty (89.97) it was about $40 dollars cheaper than the Kids HD 6 and $158 cheaper for the Kids HD 7&#34;.<br /><br />Con: (TLTR)<br />My biggest gripe about the whole thing is the storage capacity. I should have realized the 8GB probably would not be sufficient and on top I had forgotten that Kindle devices stated storage size is actually less. 8 GB (4.5 GB available to user) or 16 GB (11.6 GB available to user) of internal storage http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IKPYKWG/ref=nav_shopall_k_hd7#tech<br />Additionally, If the device reaches around 10-15% it gets laggy, games freeze up.<br /><br />Con: (Detailed)<br />So after loading up the initial profile (w/out downloading content) and then loading up a child's Free time account already starts taking up space. You have 2 accounts now with default data. So after about 3-4 hrs of my kids playing with their new devices I already had to remove content to re-enable Wifi access (yes once device reaches a certain amount it disables Wifi). Childs free time storage is not accessible from the parents account side or thru the child's account unless its reached a limit/WiFi was disabled. When limit is reached it prompts to clear storage or enabling WiFi prompts to clear. Don't make the mistake I did and exited out of it after deleting one thing because you cannot go back in. I have had these for almost 2 weeks and every day I have had to clear storage at least once and re-enable WiFi 2-3 times. After looking through storage It was clear that 8 GB is not enough (well 4.5). They says 4.5 for user storage but I noticed that even some of that still had System related items and the Amazon Appstore would take up anywhere from 500-1.5GB itself if not careful. My one son had downloaded Logo Batman (1.4GB~) and a few of their Kids book that will read to them (each takes about 100-300mb). There was also a Nuance app that was not being used that I could tell that kept re-populating with 50mb. Some of the regular apps can take up to 50mb each. These things can add up.<br /><br />Pro:<br />If you were to use this device solely for watching Netflix, Amazon Videos, anything that streams or reading standard ebooks it is a great device. The pro but not really related to the device but Kids Free time does allow for allot of parental control. Time of day it can be accessed, how long it can be accessed during that time, and they must do certain things first before using it for more entertainment purposes.<br /><br />Summary<br />So for any device developer to think an 8GB tablet (not including e-readers) should be in the product line needs to think again or more clear upfront of its limitations not all the way down at the bottom in the technical notes which only geeks typically read. For users I honestly cannot see how Kindle HD/Kids HD 6&#34;/7&#34; 8GB is suitable by anyone unless it is strictly for streaming or reading standard books.",7/01/2015,0

It is frustrating.  I also don't like how I have to log in with my pass code for the kids to get in.  I have already set screen time limits, so why not allow them to access their profile with their own code and otherwise block mine?  Oh, the other thing I don't care for is the time it takes to load apps.  When I load an app from Apple to our iPhones it is quick.  When I load one on here, it seems to take an eternity.  Sometimes it even seems to get bogged down or locked.  I guess for the money difference, and the fact that the kids use it it is fine.  I have less worry about the $100 replacement vs $500 of an iPad.  Tough call....would I buy it again.  I guess so.

Now i know they are cheaper than most tablets of similar size and power and if this had happened with just one i would have wrote it off as stuff happens.  However, with both failing like they did this tells me the kindle is truly a get what you pay for device and i highly recommend anyone considering buying one first look at other tablets by other manufacturers that while they might be more expensive at least last longer.

Going from the Nexus to this is definitely a step backwards. What they send is they way it stays...absolutely no customizing the Fire. Apps, such as Verizon Messaging, which was one of my most used apps, doesn't work. Try to open it and it goes directly to the Fire settings page. The lack of apps available from Google is frustrating. When I click on a link, it opens a new blank tab..no link. So I go back, click a second time and it will open. Keeping multiple apps open is also impossible. There's no way to scroll down and see what is currently open. It's heavier than my Nexus also. I knew some of this when I bought the Fire. It was well over $100 less than my Nexus which was the main reason for purchasing the Fire over Nexus. If this is your first tablet, you'll love it!

I didn't really know what to really look out for when it came to these devices, but I primarily wanted to use it to read books and occasionally watch videos on, and for both of those purposes, the device works absolutely wonderfully. If that's all you want from a tablet, then go for this, since it's a fairly cheap device, and it works quickly, I never had to wait for it to load anything.<br /><br />However, there are a few downsides that really bring down the overall product rating for me. Personally, I LOVE to customize my computer and phone - I like to use my own wallpapers, sound effects, and so on, and astonishingly the Kindle doesn't allow any sort of customization whatsoever. I thought using your own wallpaper was a pretty standard thing in the industry, so imagine my surprise when I upload the pictures I want to use as my wallpaper and I'm incapable of using them in that way. It's only after I went online to try and figure out where the options were that I learned that it wasn't possible. It's not only wallpapers though, the fact that I can't customize the main menu in any way, and I can'r choose which tabs I want available at the top are all little things that I like to do to personalize the product, and I just can'r understand why even the most basic form of customization is unavailable for use.<br /><br />My second issue is with the ads. In addition to being unable to customize the wallpapers, occasionally an ad will show up instead. If I want to remove this, it costs fifteen dollars. I find this to be a deplorable practice, since I wasn't given any options to buy a model that didn't come with ads in the first place, so in addition to the 150~ I paid for the Kindle, I ended up paying an additional 15 dollars just to remove the annoying ads. Granted, they don't interfere when you're reading (otherwise I would be marking this at one star), but I just hate how the device had an entire section of it exclusive to ads.<br /><br />The final thing I'm disappointed about is that there no way to use an SD card to add more space. If you want more space for these, you either have to buy a model that contains more, or buy a wireless USB card that can hold the data, which aren't cheap. It makes no sense not to have something that - again - I thought was standard for most devices nowadays. The only reason I can think of as to why they don't include it is greed, since I suppose without SD card support, some people may be more inclined to pay more for a version with more internal memory.<br /><br />Overall, for a first tablet, it works fine, but from now on, I'll be sure to really put forth an attempt at actual research into these things when I want to buy a new one. A lot of things I had assumed to be standard are apparently not, and I can say with certainty that - while the Kindle works fine and does its intended purposes well enough - I will not being buying another Kindle in the future due to the drawbacks listed above.",5/01/2015,0

I'm glad to have it but I'm disappointed that you can't customize it.  You can't set a background/wallpaper - which really bothers me.  You can't set a lock screen wallpaper.  You can't organize tabs/icons.  You can't even set what comes up on the carousel for everyone who picks it up to see (you can delete items, if you think of it, but not say just don't show \\""x\\"").  You are limited to Kindle; no Google play.  You can't set an adult Guest profile & are only allowed two adult log ins - both parties needing to have Amazon log ins.  (Why only two!?)  The battery life is disappointing & not intuitive to extend.  It really has terrible glare in daylight (nearly unusable) - much worse than my smartphone & it shows finger prints the second you touch it. Basically, I think I would be happier with an android tablet.    It's also so new that the selection of cases is very limited & apparently the front camera is new so many old edition cases say they won't work & most screen protectors look like they'd cover the front camera.    Still, despite the frustrations, I'm happy to have it & enjoy the apps I do have on it.  I appreciate the large viewing area for the e-reader functions.  I'm relieved that it defaults to a finger-swipe keyboard.  I love reading kindle books & local pubic library books on it (indoors).  It's a good size for watching Netflix with subtitles (indoors).  I like the short cut to the Amazon wish list. The built in child lock app seems decent & the built in parental controls are nicely customizable. The ads don't bother me - I get that that is why it was cheaper & they aren't that intrusive.  Plus, I've read I can get rid of them for $20 if I'm so inclined which is nice to know.    All in all, I like it; I'm having fun with it.  For the price it's great, but I'm not planning to get another Kindle when the time comes to replace it.    Update: On the plus side: keeping the kindle in airplane mode & the brightness turned low really extends the battery life.  On the downside, the built-in kids lock app requires active wi-fi.  Also, while I found a case I like, I'm still having trouble finding screen protectors that accommodate the new front facing camera.",5/01/2015,0

It was a good price for what seemed like a good product.  Don't get me wrong the thing works fine and she is enjoying it.  PROBLEM with it is that it has 8 GB of memory, almost 4.5 GB of which is the Operating System and the extra little things that are on it and you can't delete.  That is ridiculous!!  I bought this item so that my daughter could get on YouTube and play music, and mainly for pictures and the video option.  She loves using that.  She downloaded a total of 6 apps and had 2 videos on there and the memory was full.  (The videos were 5 or 6 minutes each, but still)  If I had known that this only had about 4 GB of actual memory I would have never bought it.  Unfortunately, the store I bought it from does not return electronics once they are opened.  I tried to contact Amazon about upgrading to something better, but they will not take it either.  They need to put that information on the box or have a better return/exchange policy.  I feel like I got ripped off.  Yes, she can still use it for other things, but not for the MAIN reason I bought it.",4/01/2015,0

My second complaint is the carousel only holds 30 items. I like to download lots of books and have the unread ones on my carousel-now have 30 instead of the 100 I have. Since those are 2 of the main features I used on the older version I`m not too thrilled with the new version since they are not on it. Other than that problem I like it. Got it because I wanted Skype and cameras. Those are fine.",4/01/2015,0

I received this as a Christmas gift and was pretty excited to have a tablet of my own (I have an Iphone that my kids have pretty much taken control over lol!). What a disappointment it turned out to be :( The screen is nice and clear and colorful. It is easy to use. I was able to watch shows on it very nicely using the &#34;shop amazon&#34; app. But sadly, that is all the positive I can say about it. The camera is horrible. The audio is fair. My first complaint was that the app selection was really lame. Coming from Apple, I was disappointed to see that many of my favorite apps/games were not available for the Fire. Next disappointment was that the apps that were available on both Apple and Amazon were double the price than they are on Apple. The biggest disappointment of all, no memory. I received the 8GB and within 5 days, my memory is completely full. I downloaded Facebook, Messenger, Netflix, Pandora, and about 4-5 games (low end games that don't eat up memory) for myself and kids. Since none of the games I enjoy are available in the Amazon Appstore, I was going to pass this down to my kids. I then made the mistaken of signing up for the free trial of Amazon Freetime (a service for kids that allows unlimited access to ALL children's apps for one flat monthly fee) and downloaded 3, THREE games there. I then got the message that my memory was full. I was shocked. I have about 8 games on this thing and the memory is already full? I have NO pictures, NO video, NO music on it and cannot add any because the memory is gone. When I checked to see what was eating up all the memory (since I hardly downloaded anything!), I was shocked to see that about 40% of the memory was already used by the system's own applications. Things that I cannot delete or else the tablet will not work properly. I deleted Facebook messenger, and canceled all the games I was trying to download for my kids via the Freetime (which is completely worthless if your Fire tablet has no memory to support it!). Another problem I'm having is that there is no password required to download games from Freetime, so my kids are constantly trying to download games and there is no room for them on the Fire. So it's jamming up everything. I'm not able to run apps smoothly because they are constantly locking up and freezing. I'm assuming it's because there isn't enough memory to run them and the downloading is interrupting as well. I have to keep switching to their profile and cancel all the downloads, which is frustrating because sometimes even when you try to cancel the downloads, it doesn't work. I'm going to have to remove Freetime completely which will be disappointing for my daughter.<br /><br />So bottom line, I would recommend spending a little bit more and getting an Apple. MUCH more selection from the Appstore, cheaper apps, and much more memory. What's the point of having a tablet or device if you can't do much on it? I'm not sure what to do with this now. I guess I can use it to check Facebook and do the occasional internet shopping. It's useless for my kids, so I can't give it to them. Again, I'm really disappointed. Amazon could do better than this.our Fire tablet has no memory to support it!).

I'm not so impressed.<br /><br />The physical Kindle HD 7: The actual Kindle I love for them. It's just the right size and it's just right for them. I have the Kindle HDX 7&#34; and I love it (except they have one more camera than I do. boo! lol) so I knew they would love theirs. And they do. They even received a $15 Amazon gift card each from my brother to buy books and apps. They were so excited.<br /><br />Kindle FreeTime: I HATE IT. It works, don't get me wrong, but there is NO way around some things. For example, my 8 yr old found the &#34;Escape the Titanic&#34; game. It's just a bunch of puzzles you have to figure out to escape the different levels. Well, it was free so I downloaded it for him. He got through the first few puzzles really fast, but to continue you had to buy it. Well, ANY app purchases in FreeTime are restricted. Ok, I can see why. I don't want them buying things all willy nilly anyway. So I went in, purchased the game thinking he could play it. NOPE! ***ALL IN APP PURCHASES ARE BLOCKED IN FREETIME.*** There is NO WAY around this. I found this out after 2 calls and almost an hour later with Kindle support. HOWEVER, if an app originally cost $, but it's free in the app store, it counts as the full version and they can play the whole thing. A lot of free games aren't the full version. But this also applies to games like Candy Crush or whatever. They can play the whole game, but no in app purchases.<br /><br />Now, Kindles have Parental Controls. But, in order to use PC's they have to have their own Amazon account? I'm still confused on this, because the PC's don't override FT. There are 2 different types of child profiles in FT. One for 8 an under and one for 9 and older. So when my kid is 16 she STILL wouldn't be able to do any in app purchases even if I give her permission if she is still under a FT profile. But then what's the point of PC's? Also, I've beenhaving trouble getting the reading/educational goals to work on their FT profiles, so I have to hover over them anyway.<br /><br />Overall I love the Kindle Fire tablets. The HD7s were just right for the kids and I LOVE my HDX. I'm on it all the time. I do, however, think that Kindle FreeTime and the Parental Controls need to be rethought. I love that I can control their content and screen time, but I figured I'd have a little more say in everything else too. Even the guy I talked to at the app store support agreed with me. If I want him to be able to make an in app purchase, I should be able to do that through FreeTime. I certainly wouldn't buy anything in an app THEY are playing. And if you do and they use all your power ups or whatever, then you're stupid.",4/01/2015,0

(Don't worry Amazon, you'll get that sale too) It's a bummer the house branded Fire tablet has to go back, the thing even has an option for two adult profiles, but it seems no consideration has gone into private shopping or gifting and this very issue.

It would not setup without creating a fake child to get past the Freetime setup screen.<br />2. It rebooted every hour or two as a new unit, taking about 25 minutes to do a full setup and to reload from backup (about 15 minutes of that time with a 30 mb/s very strong wifi signal).<br />3. Impossible to set up any emails.<br />Never got past this stage.<br /><br />More calls to Amazon. No solutions other than the fake kid hack again.<br /><br />The nice lady (3rd techie) told me I could either get a refund or a replacement. I asked if I could try it for another day to make up my mind. She cheerily approved my suggestion.<br /><br />Another hour had been wasted, but hopes were high.<br /><br />In the next 5 hours there were several more problems and 3 crash/reboots.<br /><br />I called Amazon again after 9:00 pm. The second person, Andy, then advised that Amazon's policy only allows a replacement for a NEW unit, NOT FOR A REPLACEMENT. My replacement was just in the process of being ser up when it couldn't get past the Freetime screen at all. I told him about my conversation a few hours ago.<br /><br />After being on hold a long time while he supposedly spoke with supervisors, he said that Amazon would make A ONE-TIME EXCEPTION TO ITS POLICY and allow a refund. I asked him again if he was seriousinasmuch as the first unit NEVER WORKED EVEN FOR EVEN A MINUTE and the replacement would not even set up properly without crashing. He confirmed Amazon's policy and my one-time exception.<br /><br />That is shameful and disgusting.<br /><br />He also confirmed that these units are full of problems.<br /><br />BEWARE OF PROBLEMS WITH THESE UNITS. THEY ARE A WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME.<br /><br />MORE IMPORTANTLY, BEWARE OF AMAZON'S REFUND POLICIES WHEN YOU BUY AMAZON KINDLE JUNK.<br /><br />You could spend weeks getting endless replacements and live in total frustration with constant spontaneous crashes, reboots, and 25 minute waits for backups to download only to find that if you get a replacement, you will be screwed when that piece of junk fails.<br /><br />I was told that the long download times related to my extensive book collection.

Nothing more. I have no intention of it being my go-to tablet, using the apps, watching TV...none of it.<br /><br />I'm a book blogger who needs it to review eGalleys and read her books. Having the Fire HD7 would fix many of the issues I had with my recently retired Kobo Aura, but sadly what I have found since using this, is that it's a jump back in time. The core might be faster, but it's heavy, bulky and THICK! And it's not an eReader any more, it's a tablet posing as one trying to make everything BUT actual books the forefront of it's abilities.<br /><br />- You can't make your books, or the bookstore the main focus of your reader unless you manually add the books to the home screen, one by one. This is supposed to be an eReader...right?<br /><br />- The carousel is annoying, removing something from it is a 4 step process. Still unsure if what's in it is just a reminder of what I have looked at lately or what's currently running in the background. If the latter, the fact it's so frustratingly complicated to remove things from, it is even worse.<br /><br />- You can not customize it AT ALL, which I find in 2014 on an item I paid $140 for to be just ludicrous. As best I can tell, it doesn't even come with background options to change it too that are Amazon approved. Why can't I have a picture of my kids at Disney as my background Amazon? Why?<br /><br />You can see my full review here: http://www.memyshelfandi.com/2014/12/product-review-kindle-fire-hd7so-far-so.html<br /><br />Basically, spend the additional $100 and get an iPad mini. All the same features, but lighter, sleeker, better camera and the ability to customize. It has the Kindle app which is the same as the Kindle itself...this being the newest item from Kindle should have been the best and the brightest and instead I get something that can't do half of what my 1st generation Nook Color could when I got it in 2010.

Both were problematic with the Fire HD 7 being a bomb due to an Amazon update. I bought the Fire 7 HD 16gb (model H with the micro hdmi &#34;out&#34; located next to the power input) in late 2013.  It had a few problems right from the start, (insertion of letters or numbers from opposite sides of the keyboard from where you tapped, etc.) which I reported to Amazon. Then both Amazon and Gmail did an update in February  which became incompatible..ie. I could no longer delete email AND the Kindle contents could no longer be seen by my XP console.  Thus, I couldn't remove downloaded docs or pix or music from the Kindle HD.  Amazon blogs showed that many other owners were having similar problems. I reported to Amazon, and then followed a nightmare of hours & hours of tech phone help and 3 refurbished replacements.  They told me they were sending new ones but they didn't.  The problems were never solved which were caused by the update. It cost a lot of money to buy new.  It only worked somewhat well for 6 months.  They would not credit my HD 16gb towards purchase of a newer model (like the newer 7) where hopefully these problems didn't  exist.  So, although Kindles are cheaper than iPad mini, Kindles are not worth the costs cuz Amazon doesn't  fully stand by their products.

I wish now that I had bought something else.,"I have mixed feelings about the Kindle Fire.  First it is nice to be able to set separate profiles on it for my kids, myself, and my husband.  It is fairly lightweight and seems sturdy.  I bought it for my boys who are 5 and 9, so it's important for it to be sturdy.  I have a few issues though.  Also, since I don't think there's a way to rate Amazon Freetime, I'm going to include that here also.<br /><br />Kindle issues so far:<br />Internet is not very fast.  My Samsung Galaxy III phone has way less memory, is smaller, and is ridiculously faster than this.  I expected better.  It's not impossibly slow, but there's a large delay where my Galaxy has none.<br /><br />Google Play Store and Kindle Fire are not compatible.  There are tons (like thousands) of apps that Amazon does not have that are available on Google Play and I can't access them.  That bites.  It's actually nearly a dealbreaker.  I don't think I'll buy another Kindle unless this is resolved.  I would have done better buying a different tablet with Android.  The reason I went with the Fire though is because we have Amazon Prime and Kindle Unlimited, and Freetime sounded like a good idea to keep my kids from accessing things they shouldn't.  I thought Freetime would be more compatible with Prime and Unlimited.<br /><br />So now here are my problems with Freetime - there are a lot.  I would rate it a 1 if I could rate it:<br />On my profile or my husbands Kindle profile, Amazon Prime and Kindle Unlimited probably work fine (I haven't actually tried to read a book or watch a movie yet on the Fires, but I don't anticipate a problem), however, I bought these for my kids and set them up with Freetime.  Amazon Prime and Kindle Unlimited do not seem to sync with Freetime very well, or in the case of Prime...at all.  So lets say I wish to allow my kids to watch any PG movie on Amazon Prime.  They can't do this via Freetime.  This is frustrating.  I want them to have access to the features I have.  I just want parental controls so I can make sure they're not going to accidently access dirty movies.  And I don't want to have to do it all for them.  I thought this would be easier for me.  It is not.  They can't access Prime movies at all as far as I can tell.<br /><br />Kindle Unlimited seems to have a different problem with Freetime.  I can work around it, but it is annoying.  What you have to do is access Kindle Unlimited via a parents/adults profile.  Then get a new book.  Then add it to your child's Freetime.  Then they can download it to their device.  This seems like a small thing right?  But I have 2 kids and one of them is a 9 year old who sometimes goes through a book an hour.  He's a very avid reader.  I do not want to be hounded by my kids to access Unlimited every time they need a new book.  Basically it is compatible, but not as compatible as I would like and the only reason I have Kindle Unlimited is because my kids are constantly asking me to download books for them.<br /><br />My next problem with Freetime is that it's set up for 5 year olds.  It's supposed to have 2 settings: for kids under 8 and kids 9-17. When you set up their profiles, you put in the age of your child and select which setting you want. Nearly all the same books and videos and games show up for both kids, even though my nine year old has the setting for older kids.  The only difference I can really see is the background color is black for my 9 year old and blue for my 5 year old, and the suggested books and games at the top are a little different.  What interest is a nine year old going to have in &#34;But not the Hippopotamus&#34; or &#34;Little Critters&#34; apps? They're not age appropriate.  And the books can't be sorted by things like AR reading level, grade level, or even boy/girl.  They're all mixed up in this silly thing.  There's no way to sort them, and there's no way to search by reading level.  They have Level 1 (learn to read books) mixed right in with chapter books.  And let metell you, the chapter books are seriously lacking.  There's almost nothing that my 9 year old wants to read. I don't expect them to have the most popular series books available, but I do expect way more than the current offerings.  As a mom, this is a big Amazon Fail in my book.  I might keep Freetime for my 5 year old, but probably not for my 9 year old.  It's just not useful.  I'd rather give him full access to Prime and Unlimited than limit him the way Freetime does.<br /><br />So here's what Freetime needs to be for any Amazon people that might view this:<br /><br />For my 5 year old, it's mostly ok, but:<br />I want a way to allow them to access Prime movies from my subscription that are rated G or PG, without me having to type in my code, add a movie/show, allow them access, and download the darn thing.<br />I want it to suggest books and move them to the top of the list based on the other books my child has shown interest in.<br />I want to be able to set a reading level/range for my kid, and I want those to be the only books that show.<br />I want it to filter out &#34;girl&#34; books about rainbows, unicorns, and fairytales.  No offense, my boy is just not interested.<br /><br />For my 9 year old, not ok:<br />Mostly the same as above.<br />I want to set a reading level/range.<br />I don't want baby books showing up.<br />I don't want &#34;girl&#34; books showing up for my 9 year old boy.  Again, no offense.  I have no problem with him reading those books, but he won't because they don't typically include farts, butts, ninjas, or vomit.  He like boy books.<br />I want book, app, and video suggestions made based on what he's shown interest in.  And I want them age appropriate.  I don't want it suggesting learn to read books about trucks showing up just because he read an age appropriate chapter book about monster trucks yesterday.  There's a huge difference in reading levels.<br />I want it to allow him access to my Kindle Unlimited, but since I also use Unlimited, I want a way to limit which books he can return to get a new book.<br />I do not want to have to add the Kindle Unlimited books to his profile myself.  I just want him to have permission, preferably based on the preset reading level/range I mentioned above and let him go.  I don't want him to download erotic romance novels, but I want him to be able to download the next 6th grade ninja book...on his own.<br />I want him to have access to all G and PG movies available on my Prime, and I do not want to have to authorize each one.",28/12/2014,0

That combined with every kids app letsyou play for 3 minutes then tries to force kids into purchasing is ridiculous! 2- this device is not set up with google at all. So no gmail, and no youtube, just bing search. No youtube? What else would I be using a tablet for?

I've had the regular kindle and I didn't like it. I've had the paperwhite which I felt was an improvement, but it still wasn't everything I was looking for. For Christmas I received the kindle fire hd. I think if I was living in the US. I would be happier with it. As it is the internet runs slow because everything goes through Amazon and I've had to download Google Chrome for a decent internet connection. My prime membership doesn't work well either because even though Amazon has a set up feature for VPN use Amazon won't connect to the prime features when I use the VPN. The ads on the free apps are more demanding than any ads on my iPad- at least on the iPad I didn't have to press x to close the banner especially not after every level of each game played. I can also buy music with the cursed one click, (but once again no prime features). The parental controls is a bit frustrating it is too easy to lock things and nearly impossible to figure out how to unlock, so I'm just using the device for me and unblocked everything everything except the login, but I would still prefer to have 1 click off.<br />Ultimately I was hoping for an alternative device to read my kindle books and view my prime membership features as I have to complete with others for time on my iPad. At the moment I can't use my Amazon Prime features so this Kindle doesn't currently meet my needs which had left me disappointed and I really wanted to like this device more, but it's not allowing me to use my prime features as I was expecting it to. I'm starting to look at other devices hoping that maybe I can use another tablet the same way I was hoping to use the Kindle.<br />On a positive note the books are in color, audiobooks play well, the camera is decent, and there is music, apps, Internet, as well. I can see the pictures in my Kindle cookbooks but I'm also disappointed that there aren't more photos, but that has more to do with the cookbook than the Kindle.",27/12/2014,0

Well while setting up this device with Freetime unlimited I manage to get myself locked out by parental controls, I contact customer service and they tell me to deregister the device so that I can register the device again.  The device deregisters from my amazon.com account and my device, except now that I go to register on the device I get a \\""registration error\\"" and cannot register it again.  I spend 3 hours with Kindle technical support and they have no idea why the device is now in a limbo state and they say that it is not connected to Wifi and that I should test it with the Silk Browser... except that the Silk browser is blocked by parental controls that I cannot unlock.  I switch 3 wifi hotspots to prove the point that it is not a connection issue especially since I have 2 kindles and 2 other HD 7's that I am setting up which are operating fine.  As the parental code is device specific (I must have mis-typed this device over the others) there is nothing they can do except factory reset, except they can't even do that because they can't ping, they can't remote alarm, they can't even send out a remote factory reset because the device exists as if it is not even connected to wifi (which I assure you it is).  Essentially I've first handedly at the instruction of Amazon quarantined my device into a state of limbo.  To make matters worse?  This is 9:30 pm to 12:48 am Christmas morning and 1 of 3 of my kiddos is going to be heartbroken tomorrow as to why his kindle is deregistered and has nothing on it except a parental control prompt that we can't get rid of..

The cusotmer service is outstanding.  Already had an issue with battery draining completely in less than eight hours overnight.  Seems that has been corrected -- possibly an app caused it.  Removed some apps we did not want and was able to leave wireless on without the battery draining.<br /><br />My issue is with the parental controls.  It seems that Amazon Free Time is the app for creating profiles.  Setting up child auomatically restricts accces to texting, emails and the store.  I want purchases disabled however, I believe I should have the decision whether are not to allow texts and emails for my child.  I found a texting app that would allow a child to text and will be looking for email.  Why can't I just pick and choose what I want my child to have access???  Don't understand why there are parental control features that cannot be used with the child profile.  The parental controls are not great.<br /><br />App selection for android and i-tunes is better that for the Fire HD.  The apps are real easy to put on and off of the tablet if it is not what was wanted.  The apps can be searched by device -- for example Minion Rush is not available on tablet but on Fire TV.  Kind of interesting some of the apps not available on Fire HD 7.<br /><br />Overall, not a bad choice for the price.  If you are looking for apps, games and amazon prime, this is a perfect choice.  Probably would not pick this just to have a tablet.",23/12/2014,0

I have a Samsung Note and everyone in our home has Samsung Galaxy S4 phones. I've also had other Android tablets in the past. I picked this because it had a bit faster processor speed than the Tab and the tech reviews online were glowing. However, I've found it to be an awful watered-down version of an Android tablet, with many Android apps and features just not available because of the dumbed down interface that forces use of Amazon app store and prohibits access to the main and largest Android app store, Google Play. It also lacks other great android features commonly found on the Samsung and Nexus Android tablets.<br /><br />What this means:<br /><br />If you have bought apps in the Google play store in the past (for previous tablets, phone, etc.) you WILL NOT be able to access them, download them, or use them at all on this tablet unless you root it, which then invalidates all warranties, etc. (and you also need decent tech abilities were you to want to try to root it).  The interface does not allow you to download the Google Play store, nor can you try to get apps from it via the browser, as something about the way they've programmed the Fire essentially makes it invisible to the Android Play store, so that the store doesn't recognize the Fire tablet as being an Android.<br /><br />Even if you've never bought anything from the Google Play store, it's still a bummer for you because the Amazon app store has a VERY limited selection of apps. If you're getting this for your kid, they want to change the wall papers and personalize the tablet. There is a very limited selection of not very interesting wallpapers and it's just not optimized to enhance your experience by customizing it with apps you'd like because the selection is so very limited. I have about 30 some apps in my Google play account. Once owned, you can use them for any of your Android products (usually) and once you login to your google account you have easy access to download them all to your new device. Can't do that with the Fire at all. So even if it does have some of the apps I like and use, I'd have to pay for them again, via the Amazon app store in order to have them. I have a bunch of medical apps that I use and some of them are available in the Amazon store, but most are not. Same with the apps my daughter has and even more so with the wallpapers and other personalizations that are typically available for Android products.<br /><br />My daughter, when checking out this tablet and attempting to customize it, was seriously disappointed and upset with it, stating &#34;my Android phone has more capabilities and things to do with it than this tablet!&#34;. If your kid is at all tech savvy they will hate this tablet.<br /><br />Unfortunately it seems like Amazon has taken a great little tablet but stripped it of it's great abilities in order to force-funnel all owners into buying from their limited app store, streaming only their videos and music, disallowing access to other great media and news and useful applications that are found in the Google Play store, thus limiting it's capabilities. There may be other sites that it limits the use of as I didn't do an exhaustive search, prohibiting Google Play access was enough for me to know we'd never be happy with it.  I'd say the apps it comes with, already loaded are disappointing as well when compared to what comes on a real android tablet (one that lets you access the full world of apps, music, books & magazines, blogs & posts, etc. that most every other Android tablet can access) It's kind of like buying a truck but blocking off the back bed area (the box area where you can put tons of stuff, the essential part of a truck that makes it so useful..) so that you can never put anything in it or use it, you can only put stuff in the front cab - why bother with a truck then?<br /><br />If you want a true Android with allthe capabilities of an android (and I can think of no reason that you wouldn't want that...) then you really need to buy an alternate Android tablet. I'd suggest looking at the Samsung tablets, such as the tab or note. I am not an Apple fan at all, but I would even say to get an iPad over this tablet as it's capabilities have just been too stunted by the limits imposed by Amazon's interface.  It's very disappointing as in general I'm a huge Amazon fan and I love my Amazon Fire TV and basic kindle. However, with this they've very much disappointed me. This tablet is limited to streaming video & music from Amazon, downloading Amazon books and light/limited internet browsing. It's true capabilities have been cut off.<br /><br />SUMMARY: Severely limited use as you can't access the thousands of apps and goodies on Google Play as the Amazon interface prohibits downloading the Google Play app and has made the tablet unrecognizable as an Android if you access Google Play via the browser. You'd have to root it in order to change this which will invalidate your warranty. This denied access to Google Play severely limits the capabilities of your tablet. If you want a real Android tablet with full functionality look at the Samsung Tab or Samsung Note instead.

I should have checked into that more, but trusting Amazon to have a good product I failed to check further (my fault). However, the fact still remains that this is nothing like an Android tablet and basically is a Kindle that can browse the internet (only on the Silk browser) and play games. It's not an Android tablet, it's a jazzed up Kindle with a terrible UI. Amazon promotes this thing as an alternative to higher priced Android tablets. It comes nowhere close to competing with a tablet offering Android with the Google Play Store. Even Apple, the most restrictive company out there, allows Google Apps on their devices. Amazon needs to get with the program and offer a more user friendly OS that doesn't exclude people from using Google Play.

After troubleshooting I was told that I could not get a replacement until the end of January 2015! After being told this I asked why, the rep told me because they had to fulfill other orders first and the replacements would not be available until after that. Seeing as this was not fair to me, I asked for a supervisor. The supervisor was incredibly nice and efficient to get me the replacement Kindle, that I received only 3 days after the call.

More options for an internet browser would be nice - at time I am afraid to open it because it has crashed quite a few times on me.

A very frustrating issue I've been having is that my device is constantly freezing while I'm using simple processes like taking pictures and opening links in emails. I would like to do work from my tablet but am worried it's going to freeze up on me.    I do really love to combined email though. The ability to sync up all your email accounts in one single place is SUPER convenient. I'm also a huge book/movie lover so the Prime deals are awesome. I've actual;y had a Prime membership for quite some time and never took full advantage of it until I got the Kindle Fire.

The Kids profiles need a lot of work. Overall, the Fire HD is a good device at this price point.<br /><br />My first impression, holding it, was that it felt cheap. The back cover feels like cheap plastic over a hollow space, where my Samsung Galaxy Tab 8 has a much more solid feel to it. But, this wasn't a device for me, it was for my 8 year old, so I wasn't hung up about that too much.<br /><br />Setting up profiles for kids is a pain. You can't do it on the web; you have to do it on the device. That is a headache. I should be able to do it anywhere and have it apply. I should be able to copy profiles from one child to another. I should be able to green light content in categories. I should, for example, be able to green light all G, PG, and TV-PG movies. I shouldn't have to decide each time.<br /><br />When I purchase a new book, I should be able to say on Amazon's site if my kids' profiles can access this title. I shouldn't have to go to the Kindle, open up the parent view, open up the child settings (for each child separately) and then scroll forever to find the title I just purchased.<br /><br />I wish I could specify which apps could be used with time limits. There are many apps that would fit my goal of 'educational' apps for 30 minutes, but I can't set that anywhere, so I end up opening up all apps all the time because the settings are poorly implemented.<br /><br />It is ridiculous that the kids profiles can't access music or movies. At all. No matter what. You can't open that setting to your kids without leaving the protected profile. Bizarre.<br /><br />Amazon's Free Time application for kids is absolute garbage for any kid over 5 years old. If your kid is under 5, then Free Time is maybe fine for you. However, Free Time is so restrictive that there is absolutely NO way to do any in app purchases, even with a password, even if you already purchased the in app purchase in the adult account tied to the device. If you have a game or whatever and you make an in-app purchase, your kids in Kindle Free Time won't be able to use the purchased content even thought the exact same app on the device in the parent profile has the purchased content.<br /><br />Free time has two modes: under 8 and over 8. There are exactly two differences: (1) the background color changes. (woo hoo!) and (2) in the 8+ version, they take away a 'characters' filter. So, the 8+ version has FEWER features than the little kid version. They don't add anything else. No options for any kind of web browser or connection. No options for any kind of in-app purchases, even with a parent password. No options for any kind of social connections at all. Nothing.<br /><br />Amazon's Free Time application is a great idea that is HORRIBLY implemented. It was the main reason I purchased the Fire over competing tablets, and it is so completely lame that it is unusable for any kid over about 5 years old.<br /><br />The tablet is great. It looks nice, and my kids love using it. I give the tablet itself a 4 star rating. The parental controls are garbage, and I give them 1 star.

The Amazon app store is terrible and the apps are horrendous. I have an Android phone and I use maybe 10-15 apps regularly (including games). None of these work on the Fire. Literally zero. The Google Authentication and app framework aren't a part of the Fire so even emailing the apps to myself and doing a ghetto installation results in a bad user experience as I can't log in to any of my apps.<br /><br />They also wrote their own browser. That obviously sucks. Which I'm pretty surprised about because I assume it's just a branded version of the stock Android browser. But it's slower, doesn't cache my tab content when I close the browser, and has weird interface querks that just baffle me. Seriously, let me freaking install Chrome on this thing. Oh wait, Amazon made really poor decisions with this device and I can't.<br /><br />It functions as well as any other tablet in terms of being an e-reader and I love that I can watch movies on it.

But it's heavy and every time I hit the home button and am taken back to a home page that sucks I'm angry that I wasted money on this instead of spending the extra $50 to get a real Android tablet that supports the Kindle app (FYI, all of them do).<br /><br />Overall, don't buy this.

Unfinished and unstable,"Bought this thinking we'd get a tablet and a Kindle which kids and adults could use. Boy, were we wrong!    The Kindle reader and streaming Amazon/Prime video and audio work, but are actually worse than using Amazon apps on other Android devices due to issues with the device.   Anything else is so frustrating you will lose your sanity cussing at Amazon.  - Wifi tends to be unstable - this despite having the latest FireOS. In areas where other smartphones and tablets work fine, the Fire shows wifi connection with good strength but nothing (including amazon) works - Need to restart the device (or turn wifi off and then back on) almost daily.  - Even when wifi works, it can be slow. For example, when accessing Amazon prime video upstairs (further from my wifi access point/router), I get messages saying the network is not fast enough to stream the content. In the same location and network, a Nexus 7 is able to stream the same content just fine (no, the Nexus 7 is not on a 5GHz wifi network).  - The Silk browser is pathetically slow - if it works at all. If you switch to another app and try to come back, the browser may have crashed in the interim.  - There is no multi-tasking - at least that you can control. You can't be sure if apps you used are still running (whether you want that or not).  - Think you can access Youtube easily? Think again. You can find some apps for this in Amazon's store, but they aren't good.  - Think you can get another browser? It's not going to be easy to find Chrome or Firefox. The Silk browser won't display Firefox's download site and won't allow Google apps.  - Like to watch videos on Comedy Central? You'll see an error saying they only support Chrome on Android. They haven't heard of FireOS.  - Search for other apps? You'll find a ton of junk masquerading as apps you may know/love, including porn apps.  _ Today, the device unregistered itself from Amazon for no apparent reason. So I ended up having to download and reinstall/reconfigure allmy apps & content again.    FreeTime is supported on the Fire - so you can set up a kid-friendly area with daily reading goals etc. But the time doesn't sync across devices, so the time read on a kindle won't count on the Fire.  Also, the Fire lacks some features available on the Kindle Paper White - such as Vocabulary Builder.  The Kindle devices are entirely different in terms of user interface etc - so don't buy a Fire because you happen to love your Kindle.    Amazon's customer service is great in their desire to make things right. But that doesn't mean they have good technical support - desire and ability are different things. They shipped me a replacement device. But it has much the same issues.      Overall, the device promises to be a Kindle reader, a device from which to consume Amazon content and an Androidish tablet. But it fails to live up to expectations as any of those.   If you want an eReader, get a Kindle paper white. This includes FreeTime profiles for kids and Vocabulary builder (which the Fire does not).  If you want a tablet (that can access Amazon content - books, prime video and music), save your sanity and buy yourself a Nexus 7. You can install the Kindle reader, Amazon music and Amazon app for books, music and video respectively, and they work better than the Fire. The one thing you won't get is FreeTime parental controls for apps.",9/12/2014,0

During the early part of February, my Kindle stopped turning on. I first noticed this after I left it idle for about an hour, off the charger, with the battery at around 54%, so there is no possible way the battery had died. Regardless, I did everything I could to try and get it to work, including Amazon's recommended instructions for those with my issue. I dealt with customer service several times about this incident and was told that I would receive a new one in the mail. Fine - however, I noticed that the one being sent to me was REFURBISHED. Apparently, in the warranty of the Kindle, should anything go wrong, you can be sent either a new or refurbished one. While this may be okay for some, it definitely wasn't for me considering I had originally paid for a new one and had never dropped it, exposed it to liquid or used anything other than the original charger. In addition to this, the refurbished  Kindle was not even sent in a properly packaged box. ONE cardboard box with just ONE plastic insulator inside and with the Kindle and charger just what seems to be thrown in! I am retracting the original 5 stars to 2, as Amazon's customer service was exceptional in doing their best to fix all of this. Though, I think Amazon's policy on *their* product is awful. Perhaps I am just too picky, but I don't think I'll ever purchase a Kindle again.    ORIGINAL REVIEW: 12/02/2014  Very lightweight and reads like a dream. The apps run well without any lag.

Where the 6 is sturdy as a brick with a nice slim bezel, the 7 inch feels almost hollow and even showed signs of pressure issues when tapping on the back (you could start to see the screen get weird). The 7 has a bezel that is almost double the size of its smaller counterparts, making what should be a small compact tablet feel massive in your hands. Where I could comfortably hold the hd 6 or even my nexus 7 with one hand, I often times needed to use 2 with this tablet. If you're at all worried about size, quality of build and one handed use.

I LOVE my Kindle, my hubby loves his, & my kids love to use mine. That alone would give them 5 stars in my book - I use it ALL THE TIME. But in the last 2 yrs, I've purchased 2 Kindles. First one began to die weeks before the 1 yr warranty expired. At first it would only work while plugged in, but then it would try to boot up, die, then reboot, die, etc. Continuous cycle. After an unsuccessful hard reboot & factory re-set, Amazon replaced it with a refurbished one. Now the 2nd brand new Kindle we bought has begun doing the exact same thing at just over a year (so past warranty). When I called support I was offered to purchase a refurbished one at a &#34;discount&#34;. However, I could have purchased a brand NEW one over the past Black Fri weekend for less than the refurbished discount.<br /><br />I really like Amazon & have wanted to love my Kindle. In fact I was planning to buy my son the kid's version for Christmas. But I refuse to buy a new one EVERY SINGLE YEAR. That is ridiculous & the technology is obviously sorely lacking with Amazon if that is the average life span. Of course they do now offer an extended warranty up to 3 yrs, but this was either not an option when I purchased mine, or it was not readily offered, because this is the first time I've seen it.<br /><br />I suppose I will now go look at iPad minis, but I'm very frustrated at all the lost content I've purchased from Amazon. If you don't want Apple to rule the world, you need to step it up & put out a better product. And yes, I know, I can read my books from the Kindle app on my phone & laptop, but seriously, who wants to read a 700+ page book on your phone...or with a big ole' laptop balanced on you? So I will finish reading my unread Kindle books on my laptop, & then Amazon will not be getting anymore digital purchases from me.

Let me count the ways:<br /><br />My main complaint is that is has a proprietary browser that doesn't act like any tablet or computer. Being used to using a Samsung tablet and various laptops and computers, I find this thing to be counter-intuitive and hard to figure out where things live (where it downloads things to, where control panels are, where programs are, etc.).<br /><br />It reminds me of Windows 8, which is maybe where Microsoft got the stupid idea for Windows 8, which is the worst OS I've yet to run across. Maybe even worse than this one.<br /><br />It's a bit heavier than my Samsung Tab 4 Pro as well even though my Samsung is bigger, has an SD card to expand the memory and I can connect it to my computer to add up to 128gigs of files with a 128gig SD card.<br /><br />The camera isn't as good as the Samsung, the chip isn't as good, and it doesn't offer as many apps as the Samsung.<br /><br />You say that's not a fair comparison? Well it's Kindle itself that is making the comparison to a Samsung tablet - it just popped up as I was looking at the specs on the Fire HD 7. It says it's a better deal because the Samsung is $199 and the Fire is now only $139 (I paid $199 for the Fire HD 7, but that was a year ago and the Samsung cost more then as well.<br /><br />At this time the Samsung Tab 4 Pro 8\\"" tablet is $200 and the Fire HD 7 is $139. For the extra $60 you get a lot more (as I mentioned above) with the Samsung. Bigger screen, lighter weight, SD card, ability to add files to via USB, and - Most Importantly - you can use Chrome or IE with it so it acts like a real computer, and also it stores things in a file system very similar to a computer so it's easy to figure out how to use, whereas the Fire HD is easy to use for most purposes but sometimes it's hard to figure out how it is designed, what the architecture is for filing files, programs etc.<br /><br />So the bottom line for me is I don't like the Fire HD, I do like the Samsung tablets, and I would not recommend anyone buy this Fire HD.<br /><br />(That said, I DO LOVE MY KINDLE PAPERWHITE as a dedicated ebook reader!)

This new one has a lot of great features; unfortunately, I have something better to compare it to - my last kindle.<br /><br />There were just several moderate to small issues with this new one that led to a comparatively unpleasant user experience.  The most irritating of these was screen freezing.  Several other users mentioned this in their reviews, which I found today when searching to see if anyone else had the same problem.<br /><br />For me, it happened 3 times in less than an hour while I was trying to listen to an audio book and play a simple connect three game at the same time.  This was never an issue on my old kindle and this is a frequent activity for me.<br /><br />Then the screen froze again later while I was trying to watch a TV show.  Each of these freezes required turning the device completely off, giving it a minute and restarting it.  Another review mentioned it freezing while searching the web.  Since listening to audio books, playing games and browsing the web are what I primarily use this device for, I'm afraid I just don't trust it to perform.<br /><br />The other small issues are that the battery seems to drain more rapidly and the download speed of apps and audio books seems a little reduced.  On the plus side, my email experience was better and the brief amount of web browsing that I did was much improved with the new HD screen and it did seem a little faster.<br /><br />Overall, even though I still think this is good tablet, potentially great if they fix the screen freezing, I just prefer my old one.

I asked several questions, but only one of those questions was really answered in the first round (what Kindles actually have display mirroring.) However, I did find out that you can \\""hardwire\\"" your HD7 to create mirroring display using Amazon HDMI Adapter for Fire Tablets (4th Generation) and an HDMI port--if you have one--on your TV. [Be careful with older Kindles, the adapter doesn't work!] I am still testing to see how using the adapter affects the battery life of the Fire. With the HDX and wireless mirroring, you can have the power cord attached so that you're not running the battery down while mirroring. I'm not sure that an HDMI connection, like a USB connection to a power source with other computer devices, will also power the Kindle. I doubt it, but if the Kindle will run for a decent length of time on battery, this may not be an issue.

If you have owned or own any other Android devices and are looking for even a semblance of that usability, this is not the tablet for you.<br /><br />TL;DR: If you use real Android devices and want that functionality, move along. If want the best access to Amazon entertainment sources give this thing a try.<br />I'm coming to the Fire line from a Nexus 7 2012 model that my son shattered the screen on. Pointing out the obvious, Fire devices run a heavily skinned &#34;Android&#34; OS that is dubbed Fire OS. Fire OS at its best is clunky and awkward, and lacks any real customizations. In the app store a lot of great apps are omitted to force use of Amazon's proprietary apps. Not that there aren't alternate ways to get certain apps to replace Amazon's but don't expect the tablet to just adapt to your preferences. For example, I got Swiftkey keyboard loaded onto the Fire and was elated when it seemed that it was going to work, only to disappointed later when the my Swiftkey was replaced again by the Fire keyboard after a few minutes of non-use. Oddly enough, the time I had with Swiftkey on this device showed me just how poor the Fire keyboard is. Swiftkey was far more responsive and gave additional customizations, such as my favorite feature of adding a number row to the keyboard. Another poorly done aspect of the Fire line of apps is Silk browser, which does not operate so smoothly as the name may lead you to believe. My biggest gripe with the Silk browser is that it does not open links from outside sources very well. I would have to exit the browser multiple times and re-click links to get the browser to load them. Fortunately, you can get Dolphin browser or  another browser to replace Silk browser and it will maintain its default status. Finally, the lack of a recent apps construct is probably one of the most frustrating downfalls of Fire OS. To switch between apps you literally have to go back to the home screen and select the app you're trying to switch, essentially multitasking is impossible on this tablet.<br /><br />Now, the good. If you're a prime subscriber and heavily invested in Amazon's entertainment selection, then that aspect of this tablet will work great for you. Having access to the Kindle owner's library is a huge plus. The prime video functionality is nice, as I can download prime video to the tablet so I can keep up with shows I'm watching even when I'm not connected. Prime music just added stations that genre/sub-genre focused. For Amazon entertainment services, this thing is great but that's about all it's good for.p you're trying to switch, essentially multitasking is impossible on this tablet.<br /><br />Now, the good.

This was one of the main reason that I purchased the Kindle over the nook. It is surprising that the IPhone's Kindle app has more choices in how to view and interact with the e-book applications.  There are too few ways to organize the books in the Kindle.  I want the Kindle to automatically organize the books purchased into genre , clarification/type (novels, history, science, biography, etc)  personal star rating give to books, average ratings of the book,  books read or unread etc. The background color and  upset are too limited. The Kindle should also let you create your own categories, share your book ratings with other reading websites like goodreads.  The e-reader does not always use the correct words. The documents applications are extremely limited and difficult to work with you cannot create your own projects and documents.  You can only important books not purchase through Amazon in to the documents and not the book applications. You cannot download document or video applications wanted!

That is so funny b/c the Samsung retail price is shown,  so you really can't compare since most time these things are on sale!<br /><br />BUT - we own 4 Kindles in our house;  one paperwhite, two Kindle Fire 8GB HD's 7&#34; and one Kindle Fire 16GB 8.9&#34;.  We really like them all, but the memory on the 8GB's falls short.  We often have to delete things to the cloud so the kids can load different games.  We've had to stop using the Kid screen because they can't do any of this themselves without the password, so its just easier to just keep them on the main screen.<br /><br />We have Samsung Galaxy phones and because the Samsung supports both Google Play and the Amazon App store - we're pretty sure our next tablets with be Samsung.  I even think the extra cost will be worth it - there are some things we can only use our phones for (like the popular app Fitbit and Disney Movies Anywhere) b/c its only supported by Google Play.  Watching a Disney movie on a PHONE screen is not the same as watching it on a 7&#34; or 8.9&#34; Screen - especially for a kid.  So even if the Samsung costs more, I think we'd pay it!!!  We really like the Kindles but in this area they fall short.  Sorry Amazon!<br /><br />And we've had to call numerous times b/c the latest updates totally messed up our kids Kindles - its still not straightened out and we've talked to so many people in customer service.

In this review, you will find out things that should keep you away from purchasing this device.  I have in my household, an ASUS Transformer, a Nook, 3 HD7 2012 versions, and the 2013 HD7.  The only one I'd like to throw through the wall is the new version. Here's why:<br /><br />1. Restriction of applications to profiles is really hard to manage, and frankly doesn't work.  Archived applications still show up, and the interface is not intuitive.  I had thought you couldn't see what was accessible, but each profile image shows up next to the applications. The archiving doesn't seem to do anything to any of the lists or access from a Kindle, so removing them their was a waste of time.  I happen to get several apps that after research are sketchy with hidden applications.  I don't want to remove because developers fix this kind of thing all the time.<br /><br />2. Removing an application from a child's profile is impossible on the Kindle.  I've archived one app, removed from the cloud and from the device in my account, restricted in the Family Library, and it's still available.<br /><br />3. Interface.  It's somewhat intuitive, but it forces plenty of things at you from the get go, and the control of the carousel and other features is clunky compared to the simplicity of the standard android interface.<br /><br />4. Alternate installation of applications.  I have alot of other apps which I need to load in outside of Amazon.  First, that process is not as easy as it could be, and they do not show up in the Family Profile either.<br /><br />If you can get past these limitations and actually like the interface and other benefits (books & Prime) that the Kindle gets you, go for it.  For me, I've rooted and installed KitKat on the other three devices.  Just waiting for a root for the new Fire to get this one straightened out.",30/11/2014,0

After sitting down and really thinking about this device I've come to a conclusion. $140 for a tablet with a advertisement ridden OS, no googeplay, terrible battery life and $150 less then an ipad mini 2. The $140 pricetag is actually expensive for what this device offers compared to its competition. This thing sucked so bad I bought an ipad mini.

The problem with only one USB port is that it is used for recharging the battery and it wears out from the continuous use. I bought two Fire HDX 7 for my grandkids two years ago and although the tablet itself is of very good quality and survived the abuse, the USB port wore out in a little over one year and replacement of them is a very troubled operation that requires the technician to work under a microscope and using specialized tools generally not available in a hobbyist shop.<br />The USB port itself is mechanically impaired by the customization to surface mount it to the PC board. Standard USB ports are mounted on PC boards via through holes which give them mechanical robustness and integrity. The Kindle USB is customized to eliminate the through holes pins and is only soldered to copper traces on the board surface only which serve the dual function of providing electrical connection and mechanical strenght. This reduces both the mechanical soundness and electrical integrity of the interface. Being that there is only one USB port, the dual use of it for interfacing to other PCs and to recharge the batteries which is most frequent and repeated on a daily basis, greatly reduce the product's useful life. The mechanical force required to insert and extract the charging socket into the USB port and the reduced mechanical capabilities result in early failure. Therefore the otherwise very good quality of the kindle Fire is greatly diminished by this simple but crucial weakness. After all a chain is only as strong as its weakest link and adding a second USB port would at least double the product's life. Being that this problem was well exposed and documented in the earlier version of this tablet, shame on Amazon and its Engineers for not at least adding a second port to this newest version if not restore the mechanical robustness of through hole mounting. I am an EE myself so I know what I'm talking about and I also know that unanticipated weaknesses sometime do not become obvious until real life use. However once they are discovered, they must be remediated in future generations. To not do so is engineering malpractice and should be punishable by law. Since that is not yet the law of the land until then my only recourse will be to not buy any more versions of this product and be negatively disposed towards any additional Amazon products.",27/11/2014,0

I've called Amazon and they are denying that I've called them and now they say it's out of warranty. Meanwhile my sons had stopped using them cause they don't charge. If you google this problem, it's all over the internet and there are Youtube instructions for trying to fix it. The temporary fix only works temporarily, then it gets worse. So if it's a software issue then that also needs to be addressed by Amazon. The only offer they have given me is that I can trade ours in for a &#34;certified refurbished&#34; one for $80. So I'm suppose to give them my $249 Kindle so they can fix it for $5 and resell it (?!) while I buy another used fixed one from them? I don't think so!!!

It consists of heavy marketing from the time you open it until it is closed. I open my Kindle to an ad, then under each icon is a variety of apps &#34;suggested&#34;, then in the games more ads (typically something I've recently looked up). Frankly I would have paid more to NOT have the &#34;Special Offers&#34; had I known. I am already marketed to by every Tom, Dick & Harry on TV & the internet...last thing I want is to be marketed to further when I am sitting down to relax with a book or game.<br /><br />Also, I am already a Prime member so apparently I did not get the 30 day Prime that was supposed to come with it. In addition to this, I have less control over my email than I had with my previous Fire. You can set it to &#34;manual&#34;, but I have yet to find out how that works exactly...there's no icon for it. I have to wait for it to refresh in 15 minutes. The quick icon for amazon is no longer there either, you have to search the internet for it. I do like the &#34;silk&#34;...very smooth to use. I don't have as many security pop ups as before (with my earlier Fire), but then again I don't have the choices in settings I once had either.<br /><br />My last complaint is that it is difficult to purchase accessories for my new Kindle due to &#34;generation&#34; issues. This generation cover doesn't fit that generation Kindle, screen protectors, replacement chargers, etc. Too complicated!

It's been a few months now and I've just figured out that when you want to buy an in app purchase for your child's profile, you are not allowed to. We purchased the different math levels in a learning game because my daughters math skills have improved and want to keep her going. But upon buying the in-app unlocks, we didn't know the unlocks wouldn't work in FreeTime. This is just crazy, I don't see how this makes any sense. I even tried deleting app, then redownloading to add to FreeTime again, still not available. What's the point of FreeTime if I can't upgrade my child's learning in a great app they love and understand?!?!?! I hope this issue is resolved soon, there's only so many &#34;great&#34; learning apps that actually show up in &#34;learning&#34; apps in FreeTime. Another issue is when you look in Educational games in the App Store, you would think they would all show up in your child's FreeTime app as a learning game to complete their Daily Goal in learning activities, but they don't. Out of maybe 15 educational apps I downloaded, only 5 showed up. Her writing apps, a few reading ones, and word games didn't show up for her daily goal activities.<br /><br />If you have younger children, this may not be an issue, but for now this is just annoying. Going through the apps, trying to find ones they'll like and use is a mission, so finding this out is a bummer.<br /><br />Other then this, I haven't had any other problems. The kindle is great for managing your kids time on watching videos, playing games, etc. Kindle has a great idea with this, I'm actually an iPad user and if iPad had this feature, I wouldn't have bought a kindle.

The battery life on the Fire turned out to be less than a day which was the main reason I was replacing the iPad to begin with.  I will say that the apps available for the Fire are pretty comparable with the apps available for the iPad.  I also got the Fire because I wanted something smaller than the iPad I had.

When it does actually load a page (Which is hit or miss at the best of times) It's usually a mobile version of that page, which has limited functionality usually to account for slower connection speeds on smaller devices.

I actually got the blue Kindle Fire 4, didn't realize I wrote this under the black product name but I'll assume the color has nothing with how it works. I'm still working my way through this new device and although it may not sound like it I do like my new Kindle I'm just trying get used to the difference between what I've had for so long.    For those of you considering the new Kindle Fire (4th Generation). Here are my observations. -Warning this is pretty lengthy.    1. I've seen and handled both the 6\\"" and the 7\\"", in my opinion that extra inch does matter. The 6\\"" can be compare to the Samsung Note 4 roughly in size for a tablet. The 7\\"" is (I'll assume) the same size as the 3rd Generation 7\\"", in comparison to the original Fire it is lighter, and much thinner. The color is brighter and the icons on the carousal appear larger to me.    2. The new features include, front and rear cameras, Bluetooth ability (I assume that Generation 3 has that), It claims a faster processor, which I guess is relative depending on your WIFI connection. I don't notice much of a speed difference between this and the original, but I do notice a battery issue (I'll discuss that later), it comes in 5 different colors (black, white, yellow(citron) , navy blue (cobalt), pink-(magenta- at least it looks like that to me). I can't remember if the original Fire came in a 16 GB or if it had \\""special offers\\"" but this one does (I'll discuss that later), volume controls on the outside, five new drop down menus,-Shop, a Games drop down menu (don't know why I have a Games drop down menu and an Apps drop down menu), Audiobooks (I'll discuss later), Photos and Offers. You can also adjust the font size for the homepage-not something I remember being able to do on the original. They also have a free time for the kids and a quiet time I guess for the adults. The family share feature I'm not quite sure the purpose for it. I've not tried the feature that let's you watch a movie by \\""flinging\\"" it to your tv. Sounds interesting but I'm thinking I need some accessory to make that happen.    3. Now for my concerns with the new Kindle-Battery life-it almost non-existent if you use the WIFI alot. I called Amazon about this issue because I thought my device was defective. With my original I never had to worry about my battery going down while I was in WIFI mode (I also didn't have an Airport mode either, so maybe that's why) all I do know is that inorder to save battery life you have to constantly flip between Airport mode on/off, on your device to save the battery life and for it to charge completely. a real hassle considering what all you have to do to get to the Airport mode to turn it off and on. It doesn't matter if you keep you devise plugged in while in WIFI mode because it still won't charge completely unless you have the Airport mode on (WIFI off). Also just a ticky issue for me-I miss my charging light, with original Fire when you plugged it in if the light was orange then you knew it was charging and once the light turned green you knew you device was close to being fully charged. Now with the new Kindle fire you have to look for this very tiny, battery icon and look on it for an even smaller lighting bolt to determine if the device is charging (not good for people with sight issues) As you can see, this is a major issue for me.    4. As discussed earlier my issues with the \\""special offers'. The advertising makes it seem as if you only see these ads when your device powers down and are like screen savors, what they don't tell you is that the ads are everywhere. I did not know that I would get \\""recommendations\\"" for every icon on my carousal (not something on the original-but then I didn't have \\""special offers\\"" on my first Kindle), unless you again go into the settings and hide the recommendations. I also, consider it over kill to have both a Shop and Offers drop down menu (a petpeeve of mine), with the help of a very helpful Amazon Rep, I was able to \\""hide\\"" the recommendations for every icon on my carousal I was so bothered by the \\""special offers\\"" and \\""recommendations\\"" I considered sending the device back and paying the extra $20 just so I don't have deal that, who knows I may still do that, it might also improve my battery life.    5. Audiobooks drop down menu-Helpful, no longer need to download Audio app to listen to audiobooks, that said I am having a difficult time closing out of my audiobooks. You can't just close the book you have remove it from your device (not a issue with the original Fire). You can stop the recording but it doesn't close the book, an it drains the battery because you can't close the book.    6. Apps. I'm also discovering that not all my old apps work on the new device. I'm not looking forward to purchasing the same apps over. I guess it's a good thing that I only gave the old one to my son so I can use that app again if I want to. Another ticy issue of mine-I'm not a fan of the layout where you go to shop for apps and it doesn't matter which one you go under- games or app drop down. It used to be left side pay apps, right side free apps, now they're all mixed up and everywhere, more annoying than anything for me.    7. Camera-From what I can tell, it takes a nice enough picture. I just don't know how hard it will be to make \\""hard\\"" copies or possibly download the pictures to a computer. I was surprised that you can take pictures without WIFI, so that's a plus.    So for now that's all I've observed. I'll update as I continue to find new things with my new device.",29/10/2014,0

I could not expand/decrease the map the way I needed.  I eventually had to drive all the way over to the local jr. college to use their computers.  I was in between moving, so I had my home wifi disconnected and decided to buy another desktop once I got moved.  Well on this Kindle most of the games I downloaded, though free, will not work unless you have wifi.  The only ones that worked were the card games like Gin rummy and chess.  Also, this Kindle will prompt you to erase many of your apps and games stating that it is low on storage even when most of your games are less than 3 mb.  Thankfully, I bought this used and paid a lot less than the new one.  Also, when starting this kindle when you press  the ON button you have to wait 35 seconds before it powers up.  I thought it worked like most gadgets and powered up right away, so I kept pressing the button until a tech person told me to wait.
